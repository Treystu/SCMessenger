# Lucas → Claude Code (orchestrator) — 2026-06-07 20:25 PT

**Re:** Agy is done. Here's the handoff. Pick it up, dispatch, verify.

---

## What just happened

Agy (Gemini Pro in your Windows cmd) ran for 35 minutes doing serious on-device Android testing + local swarm testing. I extracted everything valuable, stopped `agy.exe` PID 19276 cleanly at 20:24 PT, and rolled the full learning into a swarm ticket:

**`HANDOFF/IN_PROGRESS/IN_PROGRESS_task_agy_android_stability_complete_handoff_2026-06-07.md`** ← **read this first**

## TL;DR of what's in there

1. **6 confirmed Android bugs** with log evidence, file/line targets, and code-level fixes (1 P0 race, 3 P1, 1 P2, 1 P1 mDNS)
2. **2 UI alignment bugs** in `ContactsScreen.kt` (no `weight(1f)` + missing FAB padding)
3. **Canonical CLI operations reference** Agy compiled — promote to `docs/CLI_OPERATIONS_REFERENCE.md` after a worker validates it
4. **Empirical runtime evidence:** identity works, P2P handshake works, gossipsub works, but mDNS-direct-dial fails 100% of the time with `os error 10061` (connection actively refused) — this is the live signature of the mDNS listener-port bug
5. **Pixel 6a is still offline** (192.168.0.138:9001 actively refusing) — your PHASE 2 retest blocker from 2026-06-06 still holds

## Quota + slots

- **Quota:** 5h=1.2%, 7d=0.2% — TIER 1, 240 min to reset, plenty of headroom
- **Slots:** 3/3 free (per my earlier "agy does not count as a slot, and local llm doesn't count as a slot" reminder — Agy's gone now, but the local 7B/14B are also non-slot, so still 3 free)
- **Policy:** `local_only` is still in effect

## What I need from you

1. **Read the ticket in `HANDOFF/IN_PROGRESS/`** — it has the full dispatch plan in §5
2. **Decide:** dispatch from local Ollama (`scm-coder:7b` for Android, `scm-thinker:14b` for verification) — OR flip the pool to `mixed`/`cloud_preferred` and use the free cloud slot. I made a default recommendation in §5; just say GO and I'll handle the `agent_pool.json` edit if you want cloud
3. **Address the uncommitted test files** (`MeshRepositoryHistoryTest.kt`, `BleScannerTest.kt`) — they're dirty from the 2026-06-05 P0_024 fix. Commit them as part of the next batch or stash them; don't leave the working tree polluted for the next worker

## Recommended minimal dispatch (if you want a "just pick the next thing" mode)

- **Slot 1:** Reconcile the existing `[VALIDATED]_P0_ANDROID_024_Identity_Generation_Reentrant_Guard.md` with Agy's catalog (Bugs 1, 2, 3, 5 are the same root cause). Update or supersede, then dispatch.
- **Slot 2:** New P1 ticket wrapping Bug 6 (mDNS) + Finding A + Finding B (UI alignment) into one workstream — overlapping files.
- **Slot 3:** Verifier that re-runs `assembleDebug` + the device test (when 192.168.0.138 comes back) and cleans up the dirty test files.

## What I'm doing now

Going to passive monitor mode. Will:
- Watch `HANDOFF/IN_PROGRESS/` and `HANDOFF/done/` for state changes
- Watch `E:\SCMessenger-Github-Repo\SCMessenger\.factory\output\` (if anything lands there)
- Periodically poll the gateway log for a Claude Code session to appear

DM me on Telegram (`Home` channel, 6014795323) if you need me.
