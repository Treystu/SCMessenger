# P3: Android Retry Suppression - Implementation Notes

## Overview
Implementation of receipt window hardening (P3, A3 Step 3) for SCMessenger v0.4.0.

**Problem Solved:**
- Transport success (Sent state) was being downgraded to Failed/Corrupted when receipt ACK times out
- Receipt timeout window was too short (8 seconds) for relay custody delay + network latency

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Expanded receipt ACK window to 60 seconds via `RECEIPT_ACK_TIMEOUT_MS = 60_000L`
2. Enforced no-downgrade rule: Once message reaches Sent state (transport-acked), it cannot transition to Failed/Corrupted
3. Implemented dual-track state management: separate counters for transport-acked vs. genuine failures
4. Added comprehensive verbose logging for debugging

## Files Modified

### 1. android/app/src/main/java/com/scmessenger/android/data/MeshRepository.kt

#### Change 1: Receipt Timeout Constant (Lines 394-398)
```kotlin
// P3_ANDROID_RETRY_SUPPRESSION: Receipt ACK window expanded to 60 seconds
// to allow for relay custody delay + network latency. Prevents premature
// timeout-induced downgrade of successfully-sent messages.
private val RECEIPT_ACK_TIMEOUT_MS: Long = 60_000L
private val receiptAwaitSeconds: Long = RECEIPT_ACK_TIMEOUT_MS / 1000L  // 60 seconds
```

**Rationale:**
- Previous: 8 seconds (too short for relay scenarios)
- New: 60 seconds (allows for:
  - Relay custody hold times (typically 30-45s)
  - Network latency (multi-hop paths)
  - Queue delays (high-traffic scenarios)
- Configurable via single constant for future tuning

#### Change 2: No-Downgrade Guard in Retry Logic (Lines 6607-6626)
```kotlin
// P3_ANDROID_RETRY_SUPPRESSION: No-downgrade rule enforcement
// Once message reaches Sent state (confirmed by transport), it may NOT move to Failed or Corrupted.
// Messages that have been acked by transport are tracked separately (ackedWithoutReceiptCount)
// and should only be stopped via age-based ceiling (above), never via attempt-count ceiling.
if (item.ackedWithoutReceiptCount > 0) {
    // Transport-confirmed success: keep message in Sent state indefinitely (until age-based stop)
    Timber.d("Skipping retry for ${item.historyRecordId}: transport-acked message cannot be downgraded acked_count=${item.ackedWithoutReceiptCount}")
    logDeliveryState(
        messageId = item.historyRecordId,
        state = "held",
        detail = "acked_without_receipt_protection acked_count=${item.ackedWithoutReceiptCount} attempt=${item.attemptCount}"
    )
    iterator.set(
        item.copy(
            nextAttemptAtEpochSec = now + 120L  // Schedule next check in 2 minutes
        )
    )
    updated = true
    continue
}
```

**Behavior:**
- Placed BEFORE attempt-count check to enforce priority
- Skips regular retry scheduling when acked
- Reschedules check in 2 minutes (conservative polling)
- Logs with DEBUG level to avoid alert fatigue
- Prevents fallthrough to attempt-count ceiling

#### Change 3: Enhanced markMessageCorrupted() Guard (Lines 698-708)
```kotlin
fun markMessageCorrupted(messageId: String) {
    val tracking = messageTrackingCache[messageId] ?: return
    // P3: No-downgrade rule - log if attempting to corrupt an acked message
    if (tracking.ackedCount > 0) {
        Timber.e("NO-DOWNGRADE VIOLATION: Attempted to mark transport-acked message $messageId as corrupted (ackedCount=${tracking.ackedCount}). Skipping corruption flag.")
        Timber.d("Message $messageId state: acked=${tracking.ackedCount}, attempts=${tracking.attemptCount}")
        return  // Prevent downgrade
    }
    tracking.markCorrupted()
    Timber.w("Message $messageId marked as corrupted (acked=false, attempts=${tracking.attemptCount})")
}
```

**Defense-in-depth:**
- Catches any attempt to corrupt acked messages from ANY code path
- Logs ERROR level if violation attempted
- Returns early to prevent flag-setting
- Secondary safeguard beyond retry logic guard

#### Change 4: Adaptive Receipt Wait Updated Comment (Lines 6725-6734)
```kotlin
// AND-DELIVERY-001 / FARM WS-A3: transport genuinely succeeded, so
// track this on the separate ackedWithoutReceiptCount counter, NOT
// attemptCount - a confirmed send must never count toward the
// genuine-failure ceiling below (pendingOutboxMaxAttempts).
// P3_ANDROID_RETRY_SUPPRESSION: First receipt window is now 60s (RECEIPT_ACK_TIMEOUT_MS)
// to allow relay custody delay + network latency. No-downgrade rule prevents
// transport-acked messages from being marked Failed/Corrupted.
val nextAckedWithoutReceiptCount = item.ackedWithoutReceiptCount + 1
val adaptiveReceiptWait = when {
    nextAckedWithoutReceiptCount <= 3 -> receiptAwaitSeconds  // 60s for first few attempts (P3 hardened)
    nextAckedWithoutReceiptCount <= 8 -> 30L                 // 30s for moderate retries
    else -> 120L                                             // 2 min for later ones
}
```

**Updated Logic:**
- First receipt window now uses 60s constant instead of hardcoded 8s
- Comments clarify P3 rationale
- Maintains adaptive backoff for subsequent attempts

### 2. android/app/src/test/java/com/scmessenger/android/test/ReceiptWindowTest.kt (NEW)

**Test Suite Overview:**
10 regression tests validating P3 implementation:

1. **testReceiptAckTimeoutConstant()** - Verifies RECEIPT_ACK_TIMEOUT_MS = 60_000
2. **testReceiptTimeoutDoesNotDowngradeToFailed()** - Main regression: transport-acked message never becomes Failed
3. **testNoDowngradeRuleProtectsAckedMessages()** - No-downgrade enforcement at message level
4. **testAdaptiveReceiptWaitTimes()** - Confirms adaptive waits (60s base)
5. **testAckedMessagesFollowAgeCeiling()** - Age-based ceiling applies, not attempt-count
6. **testStateTransitionLogging()** - Verbose logging captured
7. **testWaitingBehaviorOnReceiptTimeout()** - Message remains queued, not marked failed
8. **testNoDowngradeWithMultipleTransports()** - Protection holds with multiple acks
9. **testNonAckedMessagesCanStillFail()** - Contrast: non-acked can still hit attempt limit
10. **testSeventySecondWaitDoesNotDowngrade()** - Boundary test: 70s (> 60s timeout) doesn't trigger downgrade

**Test Infrastructure:**
- Uses mockk for dependency injection
- Mocks: Context, HistoryManager, SwarmBridge, IronCore, ContactManager
- Fresh temp directory per test for isolation
- Hermetic: no device/emulator needed

## State Machine Transitions (P3-Aware)

### Transport-Acked Message (ackedWithoutReceiptCount > 0)
```
Queued -> Sent (transport ack) 
  -> Awaiting Receipt (60s wait) [repeats with 30s/120s delays]
  -> Delivered (receipt arrives) [terminal]
  -> Delivered Unconfirmed (age 7d reached) [terminal, NOT corrupted]
```

### Non-Acked Message (ackedWithoutReceiptCount == 0)
```
Queued -> Retry (failed transport)
  -> Retry (up to 12 attempts)
  -> Failed/Corrupted (attempt limit reached)
```

## Logging Output Examples

### Transport-Acked Path (DEBUG)
```
D/MeshRepository: Skipping retry for msg-123: transport-acked message cannot be downgraded acked_count=2
D/MeshRepository: Message msg-123 state: ached=2, attempts=0
```

### Violation Attempt (ERROR)
```
E/MeshRepository: NO-DOWNGRADE VIOLATION: Attempted to mark transport-acked message msg-456 as corrupted (ackedCount=3). Skipping corruption flag.
D/MeshRepository: Message msg-456 state: acked=3, attempts=0
```

### Non-Acked Failure (WARNING)
```
W/MeshRepository: Dropping message msg-789 after 12 attempts (max=12) - NOT transport-acked
W/MeshRepository: Message msg-789 marked as corrupted (acked=false, attempts=12)
```

```

## Architecture Notes

### Why Dual-Track State?
- `attemptCount`: Genuine transport failures (no ack received)
- `ackedWithoutReceiptCount`: Transport succeeded, receipt pending

This separation prevents users from seeing "Failed" when their message actually reached the peer.

### Why Age-Based Ceiling?
- Prevents infinite retries for healthy transports
- But never flags as "corrupted" (user-facing failure)
- Allows message to remain "Sent" indefinitely from UI perspective

### Why Two Guards?
1. **Retry Logic Guard** (line 6611): Prevents scheduling retry on corrupted message
2. **markMessageCorrupted() Guard** (line 701): Catches any other code path trying to corrupt

Defense-in-depth ensures no pathway can downgrade acked message.

## Future Enhancements

1. Add new state `DeliveredUnconfirmed` to UI for full expressiveness
2. Make receipt timeouts configurable via MeshSettings
3. Add delivery analytics: track acked vs. delivered percentage
4. Implement user notification for aged unconfirmed deliveries
5. Cache receipt acks locally for peer-specific latency tuning

## Testing Notes

- Tests are hermetic (no device needed)
- Use fresh temp directories for isolation
- Mock all dependencies to control test scenarios
- 10 tests provide comprehensive coverage:
  - Happy path (acked message stays Sent)
  - Error paths (non-acked can fail)
  - Boundary cases (70s > 60s)
  - Contrast cases (what CAN still fail)
