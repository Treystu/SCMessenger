## Summary

The SCMessenger CLI driver (`scripts/core_cli_driver.py`) has been verified to have **full discovery capability** across all supported transports:

###  Discovery Transports Verified
- **mDNS**: ENABLED - Local network multicast discovery
- **BLE**: ENABLED - Bluetooth Low Energy scanning active
- **WiFi-Aware**: ENABLED - WiFi NAN configured
- **DHT**: ENABLED - Distributed hash table for internet-wide discovery

###  CLI Driver Commands Verified
- `discovery status` - Shows enabled transports
- `discovery scan` - Triggers active peer scan
- `discovery peers` - Lists discovered peers
- `identity` - Shows node Peer ID and addresses
- `status` - Daemon health check
- `daemon-log` - Log inspection
- `raw config` - Configuration management

###  API Endpoints Verified
- `GET /api/discovery/status` - Discovery transport status
- `POST /api/discovery/scan` - Trigger discovery scan
- `GET /api/discovery/peers` - List discovered peers
- `GET /api/network-info` - Network configuration
- `GET /api/diagnostics` - Full system diagnostics

## Ready for Android Testing

The Windows CLI node is ready to discover and connect with your Android device:

### Prerequisites Met
-  All discovery transports enabled
-  Daemon running and healthy
-  mDNS broadcasting on LAN
-  BLE scanning for SCM service UUID
-  Multiple transport listeners active
-  Control API accessible

### Next Steps for Android Testing

1. **Start Android App**
   - Enable Bluetooth and WiFi
   - Ensure on same network (192.168.0.x)
   - Launch SCMessenger app

2. **Trigger Discovery**
   ```bash
   python scripts/core_cli_driver.py discovery scan
   ```

3. **Check for Android Peer**
   ```bash
   python scripts/core_cli_driver.py discovery peers
   ```

4. **Monitor Connection**
   ```bash
   python scripts/core_cli_driver.py daemon-log 100
   ```

5. **Test Messaging**
   ```bash
   python scripts/core_cli_driver.py send <android_peer_id> "Hello from Windows!"
   ```

## Ollama Integration

The `scm-expert:latest` Ollama model is installed and ready for autonomous CLI operations:

```bash
# Interactive mode
python scripts/ollama_cli_bridge.py

# One-shot mode
python scripts/ollama_cli_bridge.py --once "Check discovery status"
```

**Note**: Ollama was stopped after testing to free resources. Restart with `ollama serve` if needed.

## Conclusion

The SCMessenger CLI has **full discovery capability** verified and operational. All discovery transports (WiFi/mDNS, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi-Aware, DHT) are enabled and actively scanning for peers. The CLI driver provides complete access to all discovery features through both command-line interface and HTTP API.

The system is ready for cross-platform testing with the Android application. Simply start the Android app on the same network and run discovery commands to verify peer detection.
