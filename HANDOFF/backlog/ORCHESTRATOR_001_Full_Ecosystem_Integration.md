# ORCHESTRATOR_001: Full Ecosystem Integration

**Priority:** P0 (Orchestrator Integration)
**Platform:** Orchestrator System
**Status:** Open
**Assignee:** Lead Orchestrator

## Objective
Ensure the orchestrator is fully integrated with the entire SCMessenger ecosystem, including autonomous agent management, task prioritization, and cross-platform coordination.

## Integration Points to Verify

### 1. Agent Management System
- [ ] Verify orchestrator can launch 2 autonomous sub-agents simultaneously
- [ ] Ensure agent health monitoring is active
- [ ] Confirm agent termination and cleanup works properly
- [ ] Test agent restart capability on failure

### 2. Task Prioritization System
- [ ] Verify orchestrator reads from all 4 master files:
  - MASTER_BUG_TRACKER.md
  - REMAINING_WORK_TRACKING.md  
  - FEATURE_PARITY.md
  - WASM_TRANSPORT_PARITY_PLAN.md
- [ ] Confirm P0 bug prioritization is working
- [ ] Test automatic task generation based on priority

### 3. Handoff System Integration
- [ ] Verify orchestrator monitors HANDOFF/todo/ directory
- [ ] Confirm orchestrator monitors HANDOFF/done/ directory
- [ ] Test automatic task saturation (keep 6-8 tasks available)
- [ ] Ensure task completion triggers next priority evaluation

### 4. Cross-Platform Coordination
- [ ] Verify Windows CLI integration status
- [ ] Confirm WASM transport parity progress
- [ ] Check Android Native client finalization
- [ ] Monitor iOS compatibility

### 5. Monitoring and Reporting
- [ ] Implement orchestrator status reporting
- [ ] Add agent performance metrics
- [ ] Create system health dashboard
- [ ] Set up alerting for critical issues

## Implementation Steps

1. **Review Current State**: Audit all orchestrator components and integration points
2. **Fix Agent Launch**: Ensure proper agent spawning with correct model parameters
3. **Enhance Monitoring**: Add comprehensive health checks for all subsystems
4. **Implement Reporting**: Create status dashboard and alerting system
5. **Test Integration**: Verify end-to-end functionality across all platforms

## Verification

- Orchestrator can successfully manage 2+ autonomous agents
- Priority tasks are automatically generated and assigned
- System maintains optimal task queue saturation
- Cross-platform coordination functions properly
- Health monitoring and alerting works reliably

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - Orchestrator integration is essential for autonomous development workflow and must be fully operational before continuing with feature development.
