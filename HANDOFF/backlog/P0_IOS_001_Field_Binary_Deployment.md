# P0_IOS_001: Field iOS Binary Deployment

**Priority:** P0 (Critical Release Blocker)
**Platform:** iOS
**Status:** Open
**Source:** MASTER_BUG_TRACKER.md FIELD-BINARY-001

## Problem Description
Field iOS binary version is stale vs current source hardening. Crash fixes exist in source but are not validated on deployed builds, preventing proper testing and validation of iOS functionality.

## Symptom
- iOS physical devices running stale build (v0.2.0 build 4) without latest hardening
- Crash fixes in source code not available in field testing
- All field evidence collected from outdated binary

## Required Action
Deploy latest iOS binary containing WS12.22+ fixes and capture post-deploy crash-free evidence.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Build Latest iOS Binary**
   - Build iOS app with latest source code including all crash fixes
   - Ensure all WS12.22+ hardening is included
   - Verify build passes all tests

2. **Deploy to Field Devices**
   - Deploy updated binary to all physical iOS test devices
   - Use TestFlight or direct deployment method
   - Verify successful installation on all devices

3. **Capture Crash-Free Evidence**
   - Run comprehensive testing on deployed devices
   - Capture logs showing no crashes with new binary
   - Document successful deployment and stability

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Update MASTER_BUG_TRACKER.md with deployment status
   - Document binary version and build date
   - Capture evidence of crash-free operation

## Verification
- ✅ iOS binary deployed to all field devices
- ✅ No crashes observed in post-deploy testing  
- ✅ MASTER_BUG_TRACKER.md updated with completion status
- ✅ Evidence captured and documented

## Priority
**CRITICAL P0** - Blocks iOS testing and validation. Must be completed before any further iOS feature work or cross-platform testing.
