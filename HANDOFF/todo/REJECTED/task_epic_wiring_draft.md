# EPIC: System Wiring & Integration Draft

## Objective
You are a Tier 1 Master Planner. Do NOT write functional code. You must read all existing planning materials and output a strict `IMPLEMENTATION_DRAFT.md` file in the root directory so the Orchestrator can slice it into micro-tasks.

## Execution Steps
1. Read the core planning documents: [USER: INSERT YOUR PLANNING FILE NAMES HERE, e.g., ARCHITECTURE.md, ROADMAP.md].
2. Analyze the current state of the SCMessenger mesh-backed routing and mandatory relay principles. 
3. Create a new file named `IMPLEMENTATION_DRAFT.md` in the root directory.
4. Inside the draft, break the remaining "wiring completion" work down into a numbered list of highly isolated, single-file micro-tasks that can be executed by smaller 8B - 30B models. 
5. Ensure no micro-task requires modifying more than two files at once.
