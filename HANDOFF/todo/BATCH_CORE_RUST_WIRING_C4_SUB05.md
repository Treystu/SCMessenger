# BATCH: Core Rust + WASM + CLI Wiring (C4)

You are a worker implementing wiring tasks. Each task requires you to:
1. Find the target function
2. Identify where it should be called
3. Wire it into the production call path
4. Verify compilation with `cargo check --workspace`
5. Move the task file from HANDOFF/todo/ to HANDOFF/done/

CRITICAL: You are forbidden from considering a task 'complete' until you execute the mv or Rename-Item command to move the task markdown file from todo/ (or IN_PROGRESS/) to done/. If you do not move the file, the Orchestrator assumes you failed.

## Build Verification
After wiring, run: `cargo check --workspace`
