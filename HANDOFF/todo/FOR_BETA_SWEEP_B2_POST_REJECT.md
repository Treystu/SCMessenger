# [FOR BETA - SWEEP] B2 Core Transport & Routing — Post-Rejection Re-Verification

**Node:** Beta (QA & Systems Analyst)
**Model:** `kimi-k2-thinking:cloud`
**Task Type:** Sweep / State Analysis
**Collision Lock:** HOLD `cargo`, `gradlew`, `git` — no other node may run these until this task completes.

---

## Mission

The previous Alpha run on B2 Manifest Re-Anchor was **REJECTED** by Beta audit (see `HANDOFF/done/FOR_BETA_AUDIT_B2_MANIFEST_REANCHOR.md`). The working tree contains **uncommitted staged changes** that may represent Alpha's rework:
- `M HANDOFF/WIRING_PATCH_MANIFEST.md`
- `M core/Cargo.toml`
- `M core/src/store/relay_custody.rs`
- `D HANDOFF/todo/task_security_tooling.md`

You must determine whether those staged changes resolve the three rejection defects, identify what remains broken, and declare the next priority target for the Orchestrator to task Alpha on.

---

## Defects to Re-Check (from previous rejection)

1. **P1:** Is `force_state_for_test` row deleted from `WIRING_PATCH_MANIFEST.md`? (Function was removed from source.)
2. **P1:** Are all 10 `relay_custody.rs` anchor line numbers accurate? (Previous offset: -11 lines.)
3. **P2:** Is `get_unhealthy_connections` anchor accurate? (Previous: manifest 391, actual 403.)

---

## Verification Steps

1. **Compile gate:** Run `cargo check --workspace`. Record error count and any new warnings.
2. **Manifest accuracy:** For every B2 row in `WIRING_PATCH_MANIFEST.md`, verify the `Definition line` matches the actual symbol position in the target file. Report any deltas.
3. **Dead code scan:** Check `core/src/store/relay_custody.rs` for `force_state_for_test`. If present and unused, flag for removal.
4. **Test binary compile:** Attempt `cargo test --workspace --no-run`. Document if the Windows LLVM OOM (paging file error 1455) still blocks integration test compilation.
5. **Symbol existence:** Confirm all 72 B2 resolved symbols still exist and are not stub-only.

## Output

Write findings to `HANDOFF/ACTIVE_LEDGER.md` with a new dated section:
- **Sweep:** B2 Post-Rejection Re-Verification
- **Timestamp:** 2026-05-01
- **Base commit:** 48dd994a
- **Compile gate status:** PASSED / FAILED (with root cause)
- **Defect resolution:** For each of the 3 previous defects: RESOLVED / STILL BROKEN (with evidence)
- **Next priority target:** The single highest-priority file or task the Orchestrator should assign to Alpha next. Include exact file path and the specific action required.

Do NOT commit. Do NOT stage. Only write the ledger.

## Completion Signal

When the ledger is written, move this file to `HANDOFF/done/`.
