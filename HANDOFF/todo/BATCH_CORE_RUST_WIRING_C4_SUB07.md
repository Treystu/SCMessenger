# BATCH: Core Rust + WASM + CLI Wiring (C4)

You are a worker implementing wiring tasks. Each task requires you to:
1. Find the target function
2. Identify where it should be called
3. Wire it into the production call path
4. Verify compilation with `cargo check --workspace`
5. Move the task file from HANDOFF/todo/ to HANDOFF/done/

CRITICAL: You are forbidden from considering a task 'complete' until you execute the mv or Rename-Item command to move the task markdown file from todo/ (or IN_PROGRESS/) to done/. If you do not move the file, the Orchestrator assumes you failed.

## Build Verification
After wiring, run: `cargo check --workspace`

## Tasks — Group A: Core Infrastructure Wiring (routing, relay, transport)


## Sub-batch 7 of 7

1. **get_iron_core_mode** — core/src/wasm_support/ — Wire into mode query
2. **set_iron_core_mode** — core/src/wasm_support/ — Wire into mode config
3. **get_swarm_bridge** — core/src/wasm_support/ — Wire into swarm bridge access
4. **parse_response** — core/src/wasm_support/ — Wire into JSON-RPC response parsing
5. **unknown_method_error** — core/src/wasm_support/ — Wire into JSON-RPC error handling

## Execution Strategy

Work through groups A → B → C → D → E in order. After each group, run `cargo check --workspace` to verify compilation. Fix any errors before moving to the next group.

When all groups are complete and compilation passes, move ALL completed task files from `HANDOFF/todo/` to `HANDOFF/done/`.
