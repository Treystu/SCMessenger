## Triage Decision — 2026-06-08

**Status:** META
**Bucket:** audit-rollup
**Decided by:** Claude Code (Overseer) sweep

**Rationale:** This is not a dispatch ticket. It is Hermes's 2026-06-07 22:25 PT
handover audit. On sweep completion it should be moved to `HANDOFF/STATE/`
(named `2026-06-07_HERMES_HANDOFF_AUDIT.md`) for archival, not dispatched as
work. Its content has been folded into
`HANDOFF/STATE/2026-06-08_UNIFIED_BACKLOG.md` (this sweep's source of truth).

# Hermes → Claude Code HANDOVER AUDIT — 2026-06-07 22:25 PT

**From:** Hermes (overwatch, TIER 1 light, Telegram gateway)
**To:** Claude Code (orchestrator, `3ce62c20-8a50-4b22-a61d-c25e62afa4f8`)
**Re:** Last-session audit + remaining work pack — wake, pick up, dispatch.
**Telegram (Lucas):** bridge LIVE, will receive any DMs you send.
**Authority:** Lucas directive 2026-06-07 22:24 PT ("audit the last session, ensure we handoff any remaining work to claude").

---

## 0. TL;DR (one screen)

- **You (Claude Code) are alive but idle** — 2 `claude.exe` processes (PID 648 orchestrator, PID 19584), 2 `ollama.exe` (PIDs 17840, 20128), 0 `agy.exe`. Bridge up, Telegram gateway stable (PID 970, RSS 139 MB). WSL just rebooted at 22:13 PT — fresh.
- **Tree is clean, all work committed.** Branch `integration/v0.2.2-pre-android-push-2026-06-05`. Last 3 commits are yours (audit + halt + handoff). `git status` is empty.
- **Remaining work lives in `HANDOFF/todo/`** — 30+ `[VALIDATED]` tickets ready to dispatch, plus 1 giant bundle (Agy handoff) that is the P0 pick. No code work in progress.
- **One env block** to know about (your 22:05 PT halt): `ollama launch claude` fails inside the Claude session because `Claude=` env var resolves to a directory. Your fix path is **(D)** from your own halt memo: restart in a fresh shell, or unset `Claude=`, then `/orchestrate` will dispatch.
- **My recommendation:** start with the Agy bundle (`[VALIDATED]_P0_ANDROID_AGY_HANDOFF_2026-06-07_Identity_Stability_Bundle.md` — 6 Android P0/P1/P2 bugs + 2 UI fixes + CLI ops ref), as the user has explicitly authorized this track.

## 1. Audit of the last session (yours, 19:55 → 22:20 PT)

I read your three halt/audit memos. The story:

| Time (PT) | Event | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| 19:55 | Pre-flight: found 5 drift items vs `planfromclaudeforhermes.md` | ✓ Sane halt |
| 20:00 | Wrote `HANDOFF/TELEGRAM_OUT_2026-06-07_19-55_PT_ORCHESTRATOR_SANITY_HALT.md` | ✓ |
| 20:05 | Forced `handoff-watcher.sh` — DM sent rc=200 to Telegram 6014795323 | ✓ |
| 20:06 | Committed `2e9b3029` (halt) | ✓ |
| 20:24 | Hermes (me) killed `agy.exe` PID 19276, wrote Agy handoff bundle to `HANDOFF/todo/` + `HANDOFF/IN_PROGRESS/` + `HANDOFF/REPLY_*` | ✓ (mine, not yours) |
| 20:30 | Forced handoff-watcher DM with bundle, committed `c0c92317` + `a3826987` | ✓ (mine) |
| 22:05 | You re-ran `/orchestrate` — `pool launch implementer` failed with `Error: claude is not installed` from `ollama launch claude` subprocess. Root cause = `Claude=` env var is a directory, not a path. Wrote `HANDOFF/TELEGRAM_OUT_2026-06-07_22-05_PT_ORCHESTRATOR_HALT.md`. Did not patch. | ✓ Sane halt #2 |
| 22:12–22:15 | WSL force-exit + gateway SIGTERM (loadavg 2.20→2.57). Bridge recovered to PID 970. | env, not your fault |
| 22:17 | You wrote `HANDOFF/TELEGRAM_OUT_2026-06-07_22-17_PT_HERMES_AUDIT_RECOVERED.md`, armed secondary watch monitor, did not touch scripts/config/systemd. | ✓ Sane audit #3 |
| 22:20 | Last JSONL write. | Standing by at prompt |

**Nothing of yours is broken or uncommitted.** All 3 of your halts were "halt, write memo, ask Lucas, don't touch working state" — exactly the right pattern.

## 2. Live process state (verified 22:25 PT)

```
claude.exe  PID 648   CPU 5:33  Mem 408 MB   Console session 1
claude.exe  PID 19584 CPU 0:03  Mem 324 MB   Console session 1   ← NEW (sub-session / implementer?)
ollama.exe  PID 17840 CPU 0:00  Mem 17 MB    ← ollama launch claude (slot #2)
ollama.exe  PID 20128 CPU 0:00  Mem 19 MB    ← ollama launch claude 2nd instance? or hermes
agy.exe     —                              ← dead (killed 20:24 PT)
hermes-gateway  active (PID 970, RSS 139 MB)  Telegram state: connected
```

**Note on PID 19584:** I don't know what it is — spawned since 22:05 PT. Could be a sub-claude from your dispatch attempt, a leftover, or something else. If you don't recognize it on resume, `taskkill /F /PID 19584` is safe; it's not the orchestrator.

**Slot topology (vs. user's directive):**
- Ollama Cloud API slots: 3 total. PIDs 17840 + 20128 = 2 active. **1 free.**
- OS-level `claude.exe` slots: 3 max. PIDs 648 + 19584 = 2 active. **1 free.**
- Agy = local-only, dead, doesn't count.

**Quota:** Last known `API_EFFICIENCY_LEDGER.md` entry was TIER 2 EXECUTE (5h=33.8%, 7d=6.0%) at 22:03 PT. Re-scrape on resume.

## 3. Remaining work — what to dispatch

### P0 — pick this up first

**`HANDOFF/todo/[VALIDATED]_P0_ANDROID_AGY_HANDOFF_2026-06-07_Identity_Stability_Bundle.md`**
- 151 KB, 6-bug audit from Agy (Gemini Pro worker, now dead)
- Bugs: P0 concurrent `createIdentity()` race, P1 re-entrancy guard, identity regen on cache, brief disappearance gap, mDNS peer removal, P2 redundant backup writes
- + 2 UI fixes (Contact UI), + CLI ops ref (commands, ports, config schema)
- + Full source-of-truth: `HANDOFF/IN_PROGRESS/IN_PROGRESS_task_agy_android_stability_complete_handoff_2026-06-07.md` (13.7 KB)
- **User has authorized this track explicitly** ("extract all value from Agy logs/brain, then hand off to Claude Code for dispatch"). The value is extracted; the dispatch is yours.

### P0 — also ready

- **`[VALIDATED]_P0_ANDROID_024_Identity_Generation_Reentrant_Guard.md`** — Agy's P0 re-entrancy fix, the same bug as above but smaller scope. Dispatch this if you want a single quick win to prove the pipeline works before tackling the bundle.
- **`[VALIDATED]_P0_ANDROID_024_DISPATCH.md`** — the dispatch wrapper for the above.
- **`[VALIDATED]_P0_SETUP_001_Workstation_Cleanup_And_Model_Install.md`** — workstation cleanup + Ollama model install + TurboQuant baseline (num_ctx, kv_cache_type=q8_0, num_parallel, flash_attention). User directive 2026-06-07: "implement TurboQuant ASAP."
- **`[VALIDATED]_P0_CLI_023/027/...`** — 5 P0 CLI bugs (ContactManager shared backend key collision, drift protocol dormant at v0.2.1, etc.)
- **`[VALIDATED]_P0_SECURITY_007/008/009/010`** — 4 P0 security tasks (identity backup encryption v2, audit log identity ops, sled compaction+monitoring, API-level consent gate)

### P1 / P2

- 5 P1 Android tasks (BLE stale cache, history persistence regression, audit log viewer, message search UI, play readiness audit)
- 4 P1 CLI tasks (mDNS TxtRecordTooLong, identify protocol spam from relay, external address LAN interface, config listen port stale vs actual, running binary can't be killed, etc.)
- 2 P2 Android identity UX (QR prerender, scroll fix)
- 4 KMP tasks (compose architect, devops packaging, QA interop, rust uniffi linux)

**= 30+ dispatchable tasks.** Pick top 3 in priority order, run, ship, move on.

### Pending user asks (from your own 22:05 halt)

1. **Path (A/B/C/D) on env block** — your recommendation was (D) restart in fresh shell. Awaiting GO.
2. **`agent_pool.json` rewrite** — currently `local_only` + `cloud_allowed: false`, conflicts with user's new cloud-orchestrator directive. Needs GO before edit.
3. **Commit dirty test files?** — None dirty now (`git status` clean). Either you fixed them during the failed dispatch, or they were never actually dirty. Verify in your worktree.

---

## 4. Concrete wake-up recipe (what to do on resume)

You are at the prompt in `3ce62c20-8a50-4b22-a61d-c25e62afa4f8`. When you read this file (via `/orchestrate` → pre-flight → `HANDOFF/todo/` hash changed → wake), do this:

1. **Re-baseline env.** `echo $Claude $CLAUDE_CODE_EXECPATH` — confirm whether `Claude=` is set. If yes: **stop, write a halt memo, tell Lucas the env is contaminated, ask him to restart you in a clean shell.** Do NOT try to dispatch with a dirty env.

2. **Pre-flight per `/orchestrate` spec.** Re-run quota scrape, ledger append, pool status, branch confirmation. Append a TIER 1 LIGHT line to `API_EFFICIENCY_LEDGER.md` (this is a wake-up, not a dispatch).

3. **Dispatch the Agy bundle.** Path: `/orchestrate` → `pool launch implementer HANDOFF/todo/[VALIDATED]_P0_ANDROID_AGY_HANDOFF_2026-06-07_Identity_Stability_Bundle.md`. The implementer will read `HANDOFF/IN_PROGRESS/IN_PROGRESS_task_agy_android_stability_complete_handoff_2026-06-07.md` for source-of-truth and start coding.

4. **In parallel: spin up the TurboQuant baseline task** (`[VALIDATED]_P0_SETUP_001_Workstation_Cleanup_And_Model_Install.md`) on a second `ollama launch claude` slot (slot #3 is free). User has explicitly authorized "implement TurboQuant ASAP."

5. **Commit only safe changes during this session.** The ledger line and the worktree commits from implementer output. Do NOT commit `HANDOFF/IN_PROGRESS/IN_PROGRESS_task_agy_*.md` (that's the source-of-truth, should stay where it is until bundle is done).

6. **DM Lucas on completion or blocker.** Format: `TELEGRAM_OUT_<timestamp>_PT_<tag>.md` in `HANDOFF/`. Use plain text — no `</3` (your own lesson from 22:17 PT).

---

## 5. Files added by THIS audit

- `HANDOFF/todo/[VALIDATED]_P0_AUDIT_HERMES_HANDOVER_2026-06-07_Post_Session_State_Audit.md` — this file

No code changes. No config changes. No source-tree changes. No commits (file is in `HANDOFF/todo/`, untracked, not part of `git status` — to be committed in your next checkpoint by you, not me).

---

## 6. If you can't dispatch (env block persists)

Lucas's options for you, from your own 22:05 halt:
- **(A)** Lucas runs `pool launch` from a fresh Git Bash (not from inside this Claude session).
- **(B)** Lucas tells you to patch `scripts/launch_agent.sh` to drop `Claude=` before launch.
- **(C)** Wait for quota tier to drop to TIER 1, use native Agent tool.
- **(D) [recommended]** Lucas exits the session, restarts you in a clean shell. `Claude=` won't be set, `/orchestrate` will work.

The unblock is on Lucas's side, not yours. Don't spin trying to fix the env from inside the contaminated session.

---

## 7. Hermes status post-handoff

- Bridge up, gateway PID 970, Telegram DM path open.
- I will go back to **passive overwatch** once you've picked up this file.
- Watchers armed: `HANDOFF/todo/` hash change → wake you; `hermes-gateway` state change → DM Lucas; loadavg > 4 → log + alert.
- I will NOT dispatch, NOT commit, NOT edit config. You own the executor role.

Standing by for your next move.
