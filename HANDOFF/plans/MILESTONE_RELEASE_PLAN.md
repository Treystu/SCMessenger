## v0.4.0: Josh Test Release (Hawaii -> Pennsylvania over AWS)

GOAL: Two-person end-to-end messaging over the internet with an AWS relay node
ensuring mesh stays up. Real delivery. Real receipts. No hand-holding.

### What needs to land for v0.4.0:

#### CRITICAL BLOCKERS (must fix first, ~350-500 LoC total)

1. **Outbox Site-1 flush on reconnect** [SONNET]
   Ticket: OUTBOX_FLUSH_ON_CONNECT_RETRY.md (95%-complete patch exists at
   HANDOFF/review/OUTBOX_FLUSH_ATTEMPT_296LINES.patch)
   Gap: Site 1 (the primary CLI send path) does not enqueue-on-disconnect or
   flush-on-reconnect. A sent message can sit with attempts=0 forever despite
   an active connection.
   Estimated LoC: ~100-150 (the reference patch is 296 lines but includes
   tests; net logic delta is ~100)
   Blocks: FD-1, FD-2, any real delivery

2. **Receipt round-trip fix** [SONNET][AUDIT: transport/swarm.rs]
   Ticket: CRITICAL_ANDROID_FALSE_DELIVERY_FAILURE_NO_RECEIPT_ACK.md (steps 1-2)
   Gap: on_receipt_received is dead-on-arrival (nothing classifies incoming
   receipts in core). CLI uses bincode to decode a JSON payload — always fails.
   Android consequently marks delivered messages as FAILED after 12 retries and
   deletes them. Trust poison for any real test.
   Estimated LoC: ~150-200 (core classification + CLI serde fix)
   Blocks: any honest delivery status

3. **Android retry suppression** [SONNET, Kotlin]
   Ticket: CRITICAL_ANDROID_FALSE_DELIVERY_FAILURE_NO_RECEIPT_ACK.md (steps 3-4)
   Gap: transport-success must not escalate to failed/corrupted; widen receipt
   window; Kotlin regression test
   Estimated LoC: ~80-120 (Kotlin side only)
   Blocks: Android not lying to the user

4. **AWS relay live proof** [HUMAN: activate infra + SONNET: rig wiring]
   Tickets: C-05_P1_14, C-06_P1_18 (P1-14/P1-18 post-exit verification debt)
   Gap: infra/aws/ is committed but not live; WAN relay has never been proven
   end-to-end; hostile-network (netem/firewall profiles) not yet run
   Estimated LoC: ~200-300 (compose + rig scripts + health endpoint)
   Blocks: the entire Josh-test scenario

5. **DNS-name-first hardening (IP-flip mandate)** [SONNET][AUDIT: transport+routing]
   Ticket: FARM_FINAL_PLAN.md WS-FARM-B1 (new task to be cut)
   Gap: dial failure on a DNS-named addr must trigger re-resolution, not just
   backoff; negative-cache keys must not poison the hostname on IP flip; ledger
   must store hostname, not raw IP
   Estimated LoC: ~200-300
   Blocks: unattended reconnect after any IP change (mandatory for farm + Josh test)

6. **Bootstrap topology wiring** [SONNET]
   Ticket: BOOTSTRAP_TOPOLOGY_WIRING.md
   Gap: SC_BOOTSTRAP_NODES and config.json are two separate paths; CLI promiscuous
   bootstrap (cli/src/bootstrap.rs) is a third; no documented precedence
   Estimated LoC: ~100-150
   Blocks: deterministic bootstrap on both ends for Josh test

#### DELIVERY QUALITY (required for a real user test, ~200 LoC)

7. **Ledger convergence test + fix** [SONNET][AUDIT if transport fixes needed]
   Ticket: VERIFY_LEDGER_EXCHANGE.md + F1 in FARM_FINAL_PLAN.md
   Gap: integration_ledger_convergence.rs exists uncommitted, FAILS at runtime
   (missing /p2p/<peer_id> suffix on dialed Multiaddr). Fix and commit.
   Estimated LoC: ~80-120 (multiaddr suffix fix + test cleanup)

8. **Graceful dial policy** [SONNET]
   Ticket: GRACEFUL_AF_DIAL_POLICY.md
   Gap: aggressive dial-fail behavior under address churn; needs graceful retry
   Estimated LoC: ~100-150

#### OPERATOR ACTIONS (human gates, zero LoC)

- H-01: GitHub billing fix (unblocks iOS lane -- NOT required for Josh test)
- H-04: AWS relay activate (required for Josh test)
- Lucas configures port forwards (tcp/443, tcp/80, udp/443) + DDNS record

#### INSTALL ARTIFACT

- Ticket: V1_INSTALL_ARTIFACT_FOR_ALPHA_TESTERS.md
  Cut an APK + CLI binary from current main with version bumped to 0.4.0.
  Estimated LoC: ~20 (version bump, build script)

### v0.4.0 total remaining effort estimate:
- Rust/Kotlin code: ~900-1,250 LoC net logic (not counting tests)
- Infrastructure: ~200-300 LoC (compose/scripts)
- Human gates: 2 (billing optional, AWS relay required)

### v0.4.0 does NOT include:
- iOS (H-01 billing unlock + GitHub Actions fix still pending)
- Full PQC completion (waves 3-5 frozen on E1 critical)
- Meeting Mode / N-way BLE
- KMP desktop client
- WiFi Direct Android<->Android
- Farm readiness drills (those are v1.0.0 gates)

---

## v0.5.0: Farm Simulation Release

GOAL: All six farm topology scenarios pass in the 12-node Docker simulation on
the AWS rig. The software is proven against the farm use case in simulation
before anyone goes to Hawaii.

Builds directly on v0.4.0. Every item here assumes v0.4.0 is solid.

### What lands in v0.5.0:

#### FARM SIM INFRASTRUCTURE (~300-400 LoC)
- 3-group docker compose topology (Group A farmhouse/mDNS, Group B
  far-field/internet-relay, Group C dead-zone/BLE-offline) per FARM_FINAL_PLAN.md
  Tickets: FARM_SIM_PHASE_2_3_FINDINGS.md, CONTACT_PROVISIONING_FIX.md,
  EXECUTE_PHASE_2_3_ON_INSTANCE.md, ORCHESTRATE_FARM_SIM_FIX_AND_RETEST.md
  Gap: zero contacts provisioned at startup -> /api/send returns 404 "Contact not found"
  Gap: no /api/identity endpoint for out-of-band peer_id + public_key fetch
  Estimated LoC: ~200-300 (entrypoint wiring + deterministic seed + REST API endpoint)

#### DELIVERY TRUTH COMPLETION (~400-500 LoC)

  Tickets: C-05_P1_14_hostile_network_test_lo.md, C-06_P1_18_relay_task_3_node_custo.md
  Estimated LoC: ~150-200 (rig scripts, netem profiles, test playbooks)

- B6: 12-node farm sim soak (all six scenarios as compose profiles)
  Ticket: FARM_FINAL_PLAN.md WS-FARM-B6
  Estimated LoC: ~200-300

#### HONESTY / OBSERVABILITY (~200-300 LoC)
- G1: Network error observability (NETWORKERROR_OBSERVABILITY_GAP.md +
  routing telemetry ring buffer in diagnostics report)
  Estimated LoC: ~150-200

- G2: Honest message states in UI (Queued->InCustody->Sent->Delivered, no
  checkmark without verified receipt)
  Estimated LoC: ~100-150

#### ONION SEAM FREEZE (~50 LoC)
- H1: Seam-freeze test (zero live-path call sites to onion asserted by test;
  wiring point documented). Keeps PQC-09 parked with a clean conscience.
  Ticket: FARM_FINAL_PLAN.md WS-FARM-H1
  Estimated LoC: ~30-50 (test/grep assertion only)

- Full PQC waves 3-5 (still blocked on E1 critical fix)
- KMP desktop client full build

---

## v1.0.0: Fully Featured Perfect Release

GOAL: All farm readiness drills pass (10 FD drills, gating ones twice), iOS ships
to farm-mates via TestFlight, PQC is complete and adversarially reviewed through
all 14 waves, Meeting Mode works for 6-10 mixed iOS/Android devices, KMP desktop
is live. The fully featured and perfect version.

### What lands in v1.0.0 (beyond v0.5.0):

#### CRITICAL CRYPTO COMPLETION: PQC WAVES 3-5 (~800-1,200 LoC + ~500 LoC tests)

E1: PQ ratchet root fix -- CRITICAL, currently attempt 3 pending [OPUS+][AUDIT]
  Ticket: HANDOFF/todo/PQC_07_PQ_SECRET_NEVER_MIXED_INTO_ROOT_KEY.md
  Gap: handle_dh_ratchet in ratchet.rs hardcodes pq_ss input to None unconditionally.
  The entire PQ ratchet cadence is cryptographically inert post-bootstrap.
  ML-KEM secret is fixed at bootstrap and never refreshed.
  Two prior attempts BLOCKED by adversarial review (reorder desync, then packet-loss desync).
  This is the single highest-risk task in the entire plan.
  Estimated LoC: ~200-300 (design is the hard part; impl is ~150 once design is right)
  NOTE: PQC-11/13 stay frozen until this lands. Mandatory adversarial review.

  E2/E2a: Force-ratchet and PQ-refresh-without-DH-crossing defect family

  Estimated LoC: ~150-200

- B2: Escalation authority consolidation [OPUS+ design -> SONNET impl][AUDIT]
  Gap: 3 decision-makers (core EscalationEngine, SmartTransportRouter,
  MeshRepository bootstrap list). One authority = core EscalationEngine.
  Estimated LoC: ~200-350

- WiFi Direct Android<->Android (WAIVED 2026-07-09; 7+ tests exist and pass,
  code stays, just not a v1.0.0 validated cell)
  Remaining to fully complete: ~200-300 LoC (Android<->Android two-device validation + GO negotiation edge cases)
  [BLOCKED-HW: needs 2nd Android device]

- Anonymous/headless relay node (INVESTIGATE_IDENTITY_OPTIONAL_RELAY_MODE: investigated,
  found architectural work required to separate packet forwarding from identity-dependent
  message handling)
  Remaining to fully complete: ~600-900 LoC (architectural separation of packet-forward
  from identity layer)

- Cover traffic / padding / timing (removed 2026-04-20, stays out until real)
  Remaining to fully complete: ~800-1,200 LoC (full anonymity layer)

- PQC-09 onion routing WIRED into live path (seam frozen per AD-8; code exists

  Remaining to wire: ~150-200 LoC (one wiring function + adversarial review)
  Full remaining including security review fixes: ~300-400 LoC

- iOS Multipeer Connectivity full integration (exists in Swift layer, not
  fully exercised in farm drills)
