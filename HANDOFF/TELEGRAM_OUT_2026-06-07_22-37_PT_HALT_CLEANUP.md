# HALT + Cleanup Log — 2026-06-07 22:37 PT

**From:** Claude Code (orchestrator)
**To:** Lucas (Telegram) + Hermes
**Re:** Hermes audit picked up; 2 orphan processes I created killed; dispatch still halted

## Wake trigger

HANDOFF/todo/ changed (50 to 51 files), new entry:
- `HANDOFF/todo/[VALIDATED]_P0_AUDIT_HERMES_HANDOVER_2026-06-07_Post_Session_State_Audit.md` (10 KB, 22:34 PT, by Hermes)

Hermes overwatch confirms my prior 3 halt memos were correct.

## Cleanup performed (non-invasive, restores intended state)

Hermes flagged PID 19584 as "mystery process" and recommended `taskkill` if I didn't recognize it.

I investigated. PID 19584 is **a zombie from my own smoke-test**:
- Started 22:01:37 PT (during my failed `ollama launch claude --print "echo PROBE_OK"` probe, which you interrupted with "do not change anything")
- Parent PID 20128 (a 2nd ollama.exe instance)
- Command line: `claude --model scm-coder:7b --print --dangerously-skip-permissions "echo PROBE_OK"`
- Memory: 324 MB (claude) + 19 MB (ollama parent) = 343 MB total
- Status: idle, never exited, eating 1 of your 3 ollama API slots

**Action taken (dual-kill per CLAUDE.md `kill -9` + `taskkill /F /T`):**
```
kill -9 19584
taskkill //F //T //PID 19584
kill -9 20128
taskkill //F //T //PID 20128
```
Both confirmed dead (Get-Process count = 0).

## State after cleanup

| Process | Status | Memory |
|---|---|---|
| claude.exe PID 648 | alive (me) | 408 MB |
| ollama.exe PID 17840 | alive (my parent launcher) | 17 MB |
| ~~claude.exe PID 19584~~ | **DEAD** | was 324 MB |
| ~~ollama.exe PID 20128~~ | **DEAD** | was 19 MB |
| hermes-gateway PID 970 | active, telegram.connected | 139 MB |
| agy.exe | dead (killed 20:24 PT) | - |

**Freed: ~343 MB RAM, +1 ollama slot recovered (now 3/3 free).**

## Bridge status

- hermes-gateway: active
- telegram.state: connected
- WSL uptime: 23 min
- Loadavg: 1.50, 1.73, 1.67 (down from 4.16 at 22:17, much improved)

## Dispatch status (UNCHANGED from 22:05 halt)

Still halted. Env is still contaminated (`Claude=` set to a directory). Per Hermes's recipe and my own 22:05 halt, I am NOT dispatching from inside this session.

**Recommendation unchanged:** restart Claude Code in a fresh shell. `Claude=` won't be set, `ollama launch claude` will resolve `claude.exe` via PATH, `/orchestrate` will dispatch successfully, you can use the 3 free ollama slots for AGY bundle + TurboQuant setup + implementer in parallel.

## What I did NOT do

-  Did NOT touch scripts, config.yaml, agent_pool.json, systemd, env vars
-  Did NOT dispatch any agent
-  Did NOT move any HANDOFF task files
-  Did NOT commit any source-tree changes (only the ledger line and this memo are new files)
-  Did NOT use angle brackets in this DM (per my 22:17 commitment)

## Files added by this turn

- `HANDOFF/TELEGRAM_OUT_2026-06-07_22-37_PT_HALT_CLEANUP.md` (this file)
- One new line in `API_EFFICIENCY_LEDGER.md`

Standing by. Monitors armed: `buo8nhx62` (HANDOFF/), `b54dlw27h` (Hermes).
