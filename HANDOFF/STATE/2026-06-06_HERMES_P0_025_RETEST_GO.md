# Hermes Decision Log — 2026-06-06 ~01:20 PT

## Event
Lucas authorized Path A (live retest on Pixel 6a) for P0_025 verification.
Overseer is currently idle in folder-monitor on `E:\SCMessenger-Github-Repo\SCMessenger\HANDOFF\`.

## Action
Wrote trigger file: `HANDOFF/REPLY_2026-06-06_01-15_PT_P0_025_RETEST_GO.md`

Contains:
- Full 6-step retest recipe (adb install, logcat capture, app launch, repeated
  scan triggers, log analysis criteria)
- Three pass criteria with explicit grep patterns
- Post-mortem template for RESULT
- Emulator fallback command if Pixel drops offline

## Expected outcome
Overseer picks up the file, runs the retest on Pixel 6a, writes RESULT to
`HANDOFF/REPLY_2026-06-06_01-45_PT_P0_025_RETEST_RESULT.md`. Hermes then:
1. Reads the result
2. Posts summary to Lucas on Telegram
3. If PASS: confirms branch `fix/p0-android-025-mdns-listener-collision` is
   ready to merge into `integration/v0.2.2-pre-android-push-2026-06-05`
4. If FAIL: writes a `[RETEST_BLOCKED]` update and waits for Lucas's next call

## Decision rationale
- Pixel 6a is confirmed online (adb sees it)
- APK is already built and committed (`e84f4fc3`)
- The fix is structurally correct (per-call ResolveListener in ConcurrentHashMap),
  so the live test is verification of integration, not validation of correctness
- Lucas said "go" — full send, no more clarification needed
