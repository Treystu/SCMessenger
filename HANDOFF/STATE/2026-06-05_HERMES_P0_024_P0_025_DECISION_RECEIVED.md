# 2026-06-05 21:25 PT — Hermes forwards Lucas's "fix it all" decision to Overseer

## Summary

Lucas said: **"I'm not sure what you're asking. I want it all fixed."**

Interpretation: full send on all 4 items previously pending. Wrote a `HANDOFF/REPLY_2026-06-05_21-25_PT_OPTION_B.md` with the full execution plan for Overseer Claude.

## What I found before writing the reply

- **The `E:\SCMessenger-build-p0-024\` worktree has a broken git pointer** (path uses forward slashes through `E:/SCMessenger-Github-Repo/SCMessenger/.git/worktrees/SCMessenger-build-p0-024` but lives at `E:\SCMessenger-build-p0-024` — `git worktree list` shows it as `[prunable]`). The 143 files are intact, APK is built and installed. **Overseer needs to run `git worktree repair`** before any further git ops on it.
- **The integration branch (`integration/v0.2.2-pre-android-push-2026-06-05`) has uncommitted changes that are NOT part of the P0_024 worktree** — they look like build-environment hardening from a prior Overseer session:
  - `android/app/build.gradle` (55+/-, NDK 26b validation + cargo-ndk env vars)
  - `android/app/src/main/java/com/scmessenger/android/transport/ble/BleScanner.kt` (35+/-, lazy init + cache cleanup on stop)
  - `android/app/src/test/.../ContactsViewModelTest.kt` (4+ in 2 files)
  - `HANDOFF/CLAUDE_CODE_PROTOCOL.md` (19+/5-, NDK 26b Windows path + anti-pattern #7)
- **The 4 untracked gemini test files** live in the worktree at `E:\SCMessenger-build-p0-024\android\app\src\test\java\com\scmessenger\android\{transport/ble, mesh, identity}\`, NOT in the integration branch. Per Lucas's "fix it all" directive, fold them into the P0_024 commit.

## What I sent Overseer

`HANDOFF/REPLY_2026-06-05_21-25_PT_OPTION_B.md` with a 4-phase plan:
1. Phase 1 — repair worktree pointer, commit P0_024 fixes
2. Phase 2 — new worktree off origin/main, fix P0_025, build, retest
3. Phase 3 — commit protocol file diff + integration-branch hardening as separate commits
4. Phase 4 — dispatch worker pool warmup (separate; Lucas has not yet authorized cloud API)

## Process state

- Hermes: alive, telegram gateway open, monitoring
- Overseer Claude: PID 17948, 7h uptime, in folder-monitor idle on `HANDOFF/`
- Ollama: PID 188, alive, 6 local models loaded, `minimax-m3:cloud` route live
- Quota: 5h=50%, 7d=86.6% (MIXED tier, 1800s budget). Zero cloud API used this session.
- Pool: 0/1 workers active (config truth: `max_concurrent: 1`)

## What Lucas still needs to do

- Review the 3 commits (P0_024, P0_025, integration-hardening + protocol) when Overseer reports back
- Push to remote (his gate, not Overseer's)
- Authorize worker pool warmup (currently a [META] ticket waiting on dispatch)
