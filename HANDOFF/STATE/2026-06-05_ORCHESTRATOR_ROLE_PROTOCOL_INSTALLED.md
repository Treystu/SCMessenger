# Post-mortem — Overseer Role Protocol Installed

**Date:** 2026-06-05
**Author:** doc-author (subagent dispatched by Lucas)
**Ticket:** `[META]_ORCHESTRATOR_ROLE_PROTOCOL_v1`
**Status:** Installed

## What was created

- `HANDOFF/CLAUDE_CODE_PROTOCOL.md` — 81 lines, 6 mandatory sections in the order
  specified (Your role, What you do NOT do, OODA discipline, Build commands,
  Current state, Anti-patterns observed this session). Self-contained: a future
  Claude session can read JUST this file and know its role, what not to do, and
  the build commands.

## What was edited

- `HANDOFF/CLAUDE_CODE_README.md` — inserted new `## Role & Protocol` section
  between the intro and the `→ STATE/...` pointer. 3-4 lines. Pointing to
  `CLAUDE_CODE_PROTOCOL.md` as the first thing to read AFTER the orchestration
  index.
- `HANDOFF/STATE/2026-06-05_ORCHESTRATION_INDEX.md` — added `## Role & Protocol`
  header above the existing `## TL;DR` section. 3-line reminder that the
  workflow is HANDOFF + swarm.py and no new frameworks.
- `/home/scmessenger/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — newly created (did not exist). Single
  `## Overseer role import` section pointing to the protocol file when working
  in the SCMessenger workspace.

## Commit

## State machine

- The ticket file `HANDOFF/todo/[META]_ORCHESTRATOR_ROLE_PROTOCOL_v1.md` is
  currently untracked. It will be moved to `HANDOFF/done/` via `git mv` in the
  next step to satisfy the kanban state transition and produce a clean rename
  in git history.
- This post-mortem is committed as a regular file in `HANDOFF/STATE/`; it is
  NOT part of the ticket's `git mv` flow.

## Issues / notes

- The pre-existing branch (`integration/v0.2.2-pre-android-push-2026-06-05`)
  had ~6 unstaged modifications and 19 untracked files unrelated to this
  ticket (android build.gradle, BleScanner.kt, ContactsViewModelTest.kt
  variants, `WORKSPACE.md`, `.hermes-tmp.94124`, many untracked tickets). I
  staged ONLY the 3 in-repo files I own; the other changes are untouched and
  still sitting in the working tree for the Overseer to review.
- Did NOT push. Local commit only.
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` did not exist on disk; created with the import section
  as the spec allows.
