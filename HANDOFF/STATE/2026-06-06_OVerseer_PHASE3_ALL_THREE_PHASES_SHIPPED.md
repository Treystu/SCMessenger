**Commits added this session (not pushed):**

**Worktrees (clean state, all green):**
- `E:/SCMessenger-Github-Repo/SCMessenger` — `d4a9214d` integration/v0.2.2-pre-android-push-2026-06-05
- `E:/SCMessenger-build-p0-024` — `7c362c63` fix/p0-android-024-identity
- `E:/SCMessenger-build-p0-025` — `e84f4fc3` fix/p0-android-025-mdns-listener-collision
- `E:/SCMessenger-build-p0-024.stale2026-06-06/` — preserved, contains the old broken-pointer working tree with build artifacts. Not yet cleaned.

## What P0_025 is blocked on

Live mDNS retest on Pixel 6a: phone is offline (no adb devices, no mDNS-advertised adb-tls, no Pixel 6a in ARP table). Windows CLI relay from prior session is also gone. See `HANDOFF/STATE/2026-06-06_OVerseer_PHASE2_FIX_COMMITTED_RETEST_BLOCKED.md`.

## What remains (post-push, by Lucas's command)

- [ ] **PHASE 4 (non-blocking)**: dispatch `[META]_ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER_POOL_WARMUP.md` worker pool ticket to local `scm-coder:7b` or `scm-thinker:14b`. Picks up all `[VALIDATED]_P0_*` and `[VALIDATED]_P1_*` tickets in `HANDOFF/todo/`.
- [ ] Live retest of P0_025 on Pixel 6a (blocked on hardware).
- [ ] Lucas reviews and pushes the 4 local commits.

## What I am doing now

Idling in the HANDOFF/ folder-monitor (PowerShell FileSystemWatcher PID 6616 from prior session, plus the harness Monitor I armed with `bmozcs49b`). When Lucas replies via `HANDOFF/REPLY_*.md`, I will be re-invoked automatically.

## Cleanup candidates (not urgent)

- `E:/SCMessenger-build-p0-024.stale2026-06-06/` — the renamed broken worktree. Holds pre-failure build artifacts (~2GB of cargo target/ and gradle/). If Lucas wants disk space back, `rm -rf` it. I'm not running destructive ops without explicit approval.
- `HANDOFF/STATE/.hermes-tmp.94124` — a Hermes tmp file. Likely auto-cleaned on next session.
