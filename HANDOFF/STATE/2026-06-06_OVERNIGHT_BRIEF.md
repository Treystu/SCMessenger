# OVERNIGHT BRIEF — 2026-06-06 01:35 PT

**Lucas directive:** "Iterate on all unfinished work product. Make sure that wakes Claude when you drop it. And ensure Claude keeps working all night."

**Quota state:** 5h=25% (TIER 1 HEAVY-LIFT, unlimited budget), 7d=96.4% (TIER 4 territory, no HARDLOCK trigger).

**Status at start of night:**
- 2 P0 (Android 024+025) — fixes already committed, retest pending on real device
- 2 P1 (Android crash triage, LAN discovery repair)
- 2 P2 (Identity QR prerender, scroll fix)
- 39 [VALIDATED] tickets in HANDOFF/todo/ — well-scoped, dispatchable
- 4 TASK_KMP_* tickets (large multi-agent features)
- Overseer Claude = DOWN, Hermes = UP, Pool = READY (max_concurrent=1 per agent_pool.json)
- Hermes delegate limit: 3 parallel children

## Strategy (waves)

### Wave 1 (now): Bootstrap + wake Overseer
- [DONE] Worker pool warmup (3 missing dirs created, ORCHESTRATOR_LOG.md created)
- [DONE] Quota state refreshed
- [DONE] Two META tickets moved to done/
- [DONE] P0_025 retest trigger written (`REPLY_2026-06-06_01-15_PT_P0_025_RETEST_GO.md`) — but no Claude to run it. **PIVOT: Hermes does the retest directly via terminal/ADB, OR delegate to a subagent worker.**
- [PENDING] Launch fresh Overseer via `ollama launch claude` in tmux/background
- [PENDING] Overseer reads overnight brief, picks up queue, drives work

### Wave 2: P0 closure
- P0_ANDROID_025 retest on Pixel 6a (live device) — A path
- If retest PASS: confirm branch `fix/p0-android-025-mdns-listener-collision` ready to merge
- If retest FAIL: file follow-up, pause, surface to Lucas

### Wave 3: P1/P2 dispatches
- P1_ANDROID_CRASH_TRIAGE — needs user repro; could be folded into "no repro possible" closure
- P1_ANDROID_LAN_DISCOVERY_REPAIR — clear root cause (different subnets), needs Lucas's physical reconfiguration
- P2_ANDROID_IDENTITY_QR_PRERENDER — well-scoped, can ship tonight
- P2_ANDROID_IDENTITY_SCROLL_FIX — well-scoped, can ship tonight

### Wave 4: [VALIDATED] P0 sweep
Process all [VALIDATED]_P0_* tickets that have clear scope:
- P0_BUILD_001 (workspace test gate restoration) — Rust ICE fixes
- P0_CLI_023 (ContactManager shared backend key collision) — bounded fix
- P0_CLI_027 (Drift protocol still dormant) — production wire
- P0_SECURITY_007/008/009/010 — security hardening
- P0_RELEASE_001 — v0.2.1 complete notes
- P0_DOC_002 — promotion roadmap v0.3
- P0_SETUP_001 — workstation cleanup
- P0_ANDROID_024_DISPATCH — already in motion, will be closed by P0_024 merge
- P0_ANDROID_024_Identity_Generation_Reentrant_Guard — closure of P0_024

### Wave 5: [VALIDATED] P1 sweep
- 25+ P1 tickets. Process in priority order, batch by file domain.
- CLI tickets (024-033) — bound to `core/src/`
- Android tickets (022, 023, AUDIT, SEARCH, PLAY_READINESS) — bound to `android/`
- Core tickets (001-004) — bound to `core/src/`
- iOS tickets (001-003) — needs Xcode
- WASM tickets (003-004)
- PLATFORM_001 (outbox flush)

### Wave 6: TASK_KMP_* (large features, multi-day)
- Defer to morning unless a subagent can complete one in budget
- These are 4-ticket splits for KMP desktop, each is several days of work

## Rules of engagement

1. **One worker per file domain at a time** (max_concurrent=1) — no stomping
2. **Hermes delegates to 3 parallel subagents max** (Hermes's own limit)
3. **Each worker must `git mv` ticket to IN_PROGRESS/ at start, to done/ at end**
4. **Each worker writes a brief result note in HANDOFF/STATE/**
5. **Lucas is OODA escalation** — P0 failures, security concerns, API breakages
6. **Quota tier transitions trigger a Telegram ping** to Lucas
7. **Morning summary** at 06:00 PT (or on first HARDLOCK): what's done, what's in progress, what's blocked

## File-of-truth anchors

- `.claude/quota_state.json` — refresh before each dispatch
- `HANDOFF/ORCHESTRATOR_LOG.md` — every orchestrator event gets logged
- `HANDOFF/STATE/` — per-ticket state notes
- `HANDOFF/IN_PROGRESS/` — current worker focus
- `HANDOFF/done/` — completed tickets
- `HANDOFF/REPLY_*.md` — Hermes→Overseer triggers (and vice versa)

## Wake signal

If at any point the Overseer process dies, Hermes will:
1. Detect via process check (every 5 min)
2. Wait 60s for natural restart
3. If still down, write a new `REPLY_<ts>_WAKE_UP.md` and re-launch
4. If 3 consecutive wake failures, escalate to Lucas
