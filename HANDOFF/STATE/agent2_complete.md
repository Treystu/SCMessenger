# Agent 2 - KMP Shared Module Skeleton: COMPLETE

## Summary

Created the Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) shared module skeleton for SCMessenger at `/mnt/e/SCMessenger-Github-Repo/SCMessenger/shared/`.

## Files Created

1. **`shared/build.gradle.kts`** — Gradle build script with:
   - `kotlin("multiplatform")` plugin
   - `org.jetbrains.compose` plugin version `1.5.11`
   - `jvm()` and `linuxX64()` Kotlin targets
   - Compose runtime, foundation, and material dependencies (common)
   - Compose Desktop currentOs dependencies (jvmMain, linuxX64Main)
   - `compose.desktop` block with `mainClass = "com.scmessenger.shared.MainKt"`

2. **`shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/scmessenger/shared/SharedApp.kt`** — Common source:
   ```kotlin
   package com.scmessenger.shared
   expect fun platformName(): String
   fun greet(): String = "Hello from ${platformName()}!"
   ```

3. **`shared/src/linuxX64Main/kotlin/com/scmessenger/shared/Platform.kt`** — Linux platform impl:
   ```kotlin
   package com.scmessenger.shared
   actual fun platformName(): String = "Linux"
   ```

4. **`shared/src/linuxX64Main/kotlin/com/scmessenger/shared/Main.kt`** — Desktop entry point:
   ```kotlin
   package com.scmessenger.shared
   fun main() {
       println("SCMessenger Desktop")
       println(greet())
   }
   ```

5. **Empty directory** `shared/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/scmessenger/shared/` — scaffolded for future Android platform code (no files yet).

## Files Modified

- **`android/settings.gradle`** — Added `include ':shared'` at line 18 (after existing `include ':app'`).

## Existing Project Context (Read-Only)

- `settings.gradle`: `rootProject.name = "SCMessenger"`, included `:app` only before change.
- `build.gradle` (root): Uses Kotlin 1.9.20, Compose 1.5.4, AGP 8.13.2, Hilt 2.50, KSP 1.9.20-1.0.14.
- `app/build.gradle`: Read first 60 lines confirming namespace `com.scmessenger.android`, pinned NDK, signing configs. **Not modified**.

## Notes

- The `build.gradle.kts` uses Kotlin DSL (matching the task spec). The rest of the Android project uses Groovy DSL (`.gradle` files), but since the shared module is a separate Gradle project at the same root level, the Kotlin DSL is appropriate for Compose Desktop/KMP projects.
- The shared module sits at the **workspace root level** (`/shared/`), **not** inside `/android/`. This means the `android/settings.gradle` `include ':shared'` assumes the shared module directory resolves relative to the Gradle root. **This may need adjustment** — if Android is a sub-project at `/android/`, the settings.gradle there may need a different include path (e.g., changing root or using `includeBuild`). Flagging for verification.
- No existing `android/app/` files were modified.

## Verification Needed

- Confirm whether the shared module should live **inside** `android/shared/` (as a submodule) or at the repo root level (multi-repo Gradle setup). Currently placed at repo root as specified in the task.
