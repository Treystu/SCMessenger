# 2026-06-06 — Overseer: PHASE 1 recovered and restored

**Status:** PHASE 1 worktree repair succeeded; 3 modifications + 2 untracked test files restored from `/tmp/p0-024-backup/`; commit pending
**Date:** 2026-06-06 00:38 PT (resumed from 2026-06-05 session)
**Branch:** `fix/p0-android-024-identity` (HEAD = dd109707)
**Worktree:** `E:\SCMessenger-build-p0-024\` — re-attached to main repo via `git worktree add`

---

## What happened in PHASE 1

1. The worktree at `E:\SCMessenger-build-p0-024\` had a broken `.git` file pointer.
2. The `.git/worktrees/SCMessenger-build-p0-024` admin directory was missing in the main repo.
3. Files were preserved by backing them up to `/tmp/p0-024-backup/`:
   - 3 modified files: `MainViewModel.kt`, `OnboardingScreen.kt`, `BleScanner.kt`
   - 2 untracked test files: `BleScannerTest.kt`, `MeshRepositoryHistoryTest.kt`
   - 2 more untracked tests (`IdentityFlowRegressionTest.kt`, `MeshRepositoryTest.kt`) were ALREADY in tree (committed in earlier commits on this branch).
4. The broken dir was renamed to `E:\SCMessenger-build-p0-024.stale2026-06-06\` (the `mv` from Git Bash failed with "Device or resource busy" — PowerShell `Rename-Item` succeeded on attempt 1).
5. `git worktree add E:/SCMessenger-build-p0-024 fix/p0-android-024-identity` succeeded — git cleanly checked out dd109707.
6. The 3 modified files were re-copied from `/tmp/p0-024-backup/`; the 2 untracked test files were re-copied to their canonical paths.

## Files staged for commit on `fix/p0-android-024-identity`

Modified:
- `android/app/src/main/java/com/scmessenger/android/ui/viewmodels/MainViewModel.kt` — re-entrancy guard on `createIdentity()`
- `android/app/src/main/java/com/scmessenger/android/ui/screens/OnboardingScreen.kt` — `&& !isCreating` defense
- `android/app/src/main/java/com/scmessenger/android/transport/ble/BleScanner.kt` — `clearPeerCache()` in `stopScanning()`

Untracked (will be added to the same commit per Lucas's "I want it all fixed"):
- `android/app/src/test/java/com/scmessenger/android/transport/ble/BleScannerTest.kt`
- `android/app/src/androidTest/java/com/scmessenger/android/data/MeshRepositoryHistoryTest.kt`

(Also `IdentityFlowRegressionTest.kt` and `MeshRepositoryTest.kt` — already committed on this branch in earlier commits.)

## Build state in the worktree

The renamed stale dir `E:\SCMessenger-build-p0-024.stale2026-06-06\` still contains the Rust build artifacts (`core/target/`, `.gradle/`, `.cargo/`, `node_modules/`, etc.). These were NOT carried over to the new worktree (would have cost significant time/copy). Rebuild from scratch on demand is the expected next step.

## Next: commit on `fix/p0-android-024-identity`

Per the Telegram reply, the commit message template was:

```
fix(android): re-entrancy guard on createIdentity + BLE peer cache cleanup

P0_ANDROID_024 — Identity generation regression fix.
- MainViewModel: guard re-entrant createIdentity() calls
- OnboardingScreen: defense-in-depth UI flag
- BleScanner: clear peer cache on scan stop (P1_022 cleanup)

Verified: APK 291MB, installed on Pixel 6a (versionCode=7), onboarding retests green.
Pre-existing P0_ANDROID_025 (mDNS listener collision) tracked separately.
```

## What remains

- [ ] PHASE 1: commit on `fix/p0-android-024-identity` (worktree now clean enough to do this).
- [ ] PHASE 2: create `E:\SCMessenger-build-p0-025\` worktree from `origin/main`, apply 15-LoC fix to `MdnsServiceDiscovery.kt:476`, build + install + retest, commit on `fix/p0-android-025-mdns-listener-collision`.
- [ ] PHASE 3: commit `HANDOFF/CLAUDE_CODE_PROTOCOL.md` and the 4 integration-branch changes (`build.gradle`, `BleScanner.kt`, `ContactsViewModelTest.kt` x2) as a separate commit on `integration/v0.2.2-pre-android-push-2026-06-05`.
- [ ] PHASE 4 (non-blocking): dispatch `[META]_ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER_POOL_WARMUP.md` worker pool ticket.
- [ ] Do NOT push. Do NOT exit. Idle in folder-monitor on `HANDOFF/`.
