# Worker Pool Warm-up — Framework Already Live (Post-Mortem 2026-06-05)

**Author:** Hermes subagent (META-bootstrap role)
**Session:** 2026-06-05 21:00 PT, on `integration/v0.2.2-pre-android-push-2026-06-05`
**Scope:** Protocol repair + worker-pool-warmup dispatch ticket authoring

---

The orchestrator framework is warm and live: Overseer Claude Code session (PID 17948, 3h+ runtime) and the Hermes Telegram gateway are both running and coordinating. What was cold was the **worker pool** — no agent was processing a HANDOFF ticket. This post-mortem documents the worker-pool warm-up: the 5 surfaces that needed to be re-established (quota refresh, dirs, log, pool health) and the 3 dispatch tickets now ready to fill the 1 available worker slot.

## Commits

| SHA | Subject |
|-----|---------|
| `62a827e4` | fix(protocol): correct the orchestrate skill assertion — it's a slash command at .claude/commands/orchestrate.md |
| `e5f8b6ff` | orchestration: bootstrap cold swarm — 3 dispatch tickets ready (cold-start, P0 dispatch, quota ledger repair) |
| `4417afae` | docs(handoff): post-mortem on cold swarm bootstrap |

## New ticket paths

- `HANDOFF/todo/[META]_ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER_POOL_WARMUP.md` — 5-step worker-pool warm-up procedure (quota refresh, orchestrator activate, dir creation, log bootstrap, pool health check). 600s budget, qwen3-coder:cloud. **[META] [TIER: 1-2] [BLOCKS: ALL_P0_DISPATCH] [SLOTS_AVAILABLE: 1]**
- `HANDOFF/todo/[VALIDATED]_P0_ANDROID_024_DISPATCH.md` — dispatch contract for the existing P0 spec at `HANDOFF/todo/P0_ANDROID_024_IDENTITY_GENERATION_REGRESSION.md`. 1800s budget, implementer agent (`qwen3-coder-next:cloud`). **[P0] [TIER: 2-3] [DEPENDS_ON: worker-pool-warmup]**
- `HANDOFF/todo/[META]_QUOTA_LEDGER_REPAIR.md` — 3-step doc-only repair of the 16-day-stale quota pipeline and missing/stale `API_EFFICIENCY_LEDGER.md`. 300s budget, gemma4:31b:cloud via worker. **[META] [TIER: 1] [LOW_PRIORITY_DOCS]**

## Cold-start state observed vs recovered state

| Surface | Observed (20:50 PT) | After this run |
|---|---|---|
| Framework status | WARM (no change) | WARM (no change) |
| `.claude/quota_state.json` `timestamp` | `2026-05-20` (16 days stale) | Still stale — **NOT YET SCRAPED**. Cold-start ticket #1 will refresh. |
| `.claude/orchestrator_state.json` | Missing | Still missing — **NOT YET ACTIVATED**. Cold-start ticket #2 will create. |
| `HANDOFF/IN_PROGRESS/` | Missing | Still missing — **NOT YET CREATED**. Cold-start ticket #3 will mkdir. |
| Worker workspaces (`.claude/agents/`) | Missing | Still missing — **NOT YET CREATED**. Cold-start ticket #3 will mkdir. |
| `HANDOFF/ORCHESTRATOR_LOG.md` | Missing | Still missing — **NOT YET CREATED**. Cold-start ticket #4 will bootstrap. |
| Worker pool slots (1 configured, was 0/3 by stale display) | `0/3` (cold) | 0 → 1 available after this warm-up. |
| `pool status` returns "No agents active" |  |  (unchanged — no workers launched this session) |

**Note:** The Overseer Claude Code session (PID 17948, 3h+ runtime) and the Telegram Hermes session are the **framework layer** (Tier 1 / orchestrator process + cross-session coordination surface), NOT worker pool slots. The pool's `0/3` display is the script's default max — the real config in `.claude/agent_pool.json` is `max_concurrent: 1`.
| `HANDOFF/CLAUDE_CODE_PROTOCOL.md` | False claim on line 28: "the `orchestrate` skill does not exist" | **FIXED**. Section 1 references the real `.claude/orchestrator_manager.sh pool launch` workflow; Section 2 cites `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md` + `docs/ORCHESTRATE_V4_COMMAND.md`; Section 6 item #6 corrected; new Section 7 "Pool invocation" added (42 lines: status/launch/patrol/stop/activate, 6-tier quota governor, 5-min staleness rule, 8-agent routing table, Windows Git Bash path note, slot limit). |

**This run did not run the orchestrator pool.** It only (a) corrected the protocol file's claims and (b) authored 3 dispatch tickets. These tickets prepare the worker pool to receive its first dispatch (Cold Start Recovery), repair the stale quota + missing ledger (Quota Ledger Repair, parallel-safe with #1), and finally launch the P0 Android 024 dispatch (sequential, after #1 and quota tier ≤ LIGHT).

## Why this approach

The previous META subagent authored `HANDOFF/CLAUDE_CODE_PROTOCOL.md` (committed `c13c22c4`) but made a false assertion that the `orchestrate` skill does not exist. In reality, the orchestration system is:

- `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md` — 146-line Claude Code slash command, v4.0 spec
- `.claude/orchestrator_manager.sh` — bash entry point with `pool status|launch|patrol|stop|activate`
- `docs/ORCHESTRATE_V4_COMMAND.md` — 416-line full spec (hybrid cloud/local routing, 6-tier quota governor, DAG scheduling)

The Overseer role protocol (the document Claude Code reads at session start) must reflect this. False claims there are a *self-referential* failure mode: Claude Code reads the lie, behaves as if it's true, and the swarm never warms.

The fix is the protocol patch (`62a827e4`) plus the three new tickets that put the corrected understanding into executable form.

## Next session checklist

**Framework is warm. Worker pool is the only thing cold. Run these tickets to fill the 1 worker slot.**

When the next Claude Code session (or the Overseer's first action in a new window) begins, work this list in order:

1. **`[META]_ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER_POOL_WARMUP`** — **Priority 1, must run first.** Without a warm pool, no other dispatch will start. Quota refresh → orchestrator activate → IN_PROGRESS/ + .claude/agents/ mkdir → ORCHESTRATOR_LOG.md bootstrap → `pool status` confirmation. 600s budget. **No dependencies.**

2. **`[VALIDATED]_P0_ANDROID_024_DISPATCH`** — **Priority 2, depends on #1.** The P0 spec is complete; this ticket is the dispatch contract. Pre-flight quota check (abort on HARDLOCK) → pre-flight pool check (free slot) → `pool launch implementer` → tail agent log → on COMPLETE run `cargo check --workspace` + `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug -x lint --quiet` → `git mv` P0 spec and this ticket to `done/` → write `HANDOFF/STATE/2026-06-05_P0_ANDROID_024_RESOLVED.md`. 1800s budget. **Sequential after #1 — the P0 is user-blocking.**

3. **`[META]_QUOTA_LEDGER_REPAIR`** — **Priority 3, can run in parallel with #2.** Doc-only repair of the 16-day-stale quota accounting pipeline. Re-scrape quota → verify/create `API_EFFICIENCY_LEDGER.md` with the `[2026-06-05]` wake-cycle line → write 3-line note to `HANDOFF/STATE/2026-06-05_QUOTA_LEDGER_REPAIR.md`. 300s budget. **No dependencies, parallel-safe with #2 once #1 is done.**

### Dependency graph

```
[COLD_START_RECOVERY] ──> [P0_ANDROID_024_DISPATCH]
        │
        └────────────────────> [QUOTA_LEDGER_REPAIR]
                                    (parallel with P0 dispatch)
```

### Slot budget (2–3 concurrent max)

- Tickets #1 and #3 are both small (600s and 300s) and can likely run together in the same 600s window if the pool is set to `max_concurrent: 2`.
- Ticket #2 is the long one (1800s) and should be the only P0/P1 work in flight during its run.

## Verification commands for the next session

```bash
# Confirm the protocol fix landed
grep -n "orchestrate" HANDOFF/CLAUDE_CODE_PROTOCOL.md | head -10
grep -n "^## Pool invocation" HANDOFF/CLAUDE_CODE_PROTOCOL.md

# Confirm tickets are in todo/
ls -la "HANDOFF/todo/[META]_ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER_POOL_WARMUP.md" \
       "HANDOFF/todo/[VALIDATED]_P0_ANDROID_024_DISPATCH.md" \
       "HANDOFF/todo/[META]_QUOTA_LEDGER_REPAIR.md"

# Read the 3-ticket summary in this file
cat HANDOFF/STATE/2026-06-05_COLD_SWARM_BOOTSTRAP.md

# Begin ticket #1
cat "HANDOFF/todo/[META]_ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER_POOL_WARMUP.md"
```

## Hard constraints respected

- Local commits only; no push.
- Explicit `git add <path>...` for each commit; the 4 unrelated dirty files (BleScanner.kt, build.gradle, 2 test files) and ~19 untracked sibling tickets were **not** swept in.
- All artifacts under `HANDOFF/`; no `/tmp` writes.
- `HANDOFF/STATE/2026-06-05_ORCHESTRATION_INDEX.md` and `HANDOFF/CLAUDE_CODE_README.md` were not touched (committed at `c13c22c4` by the previous META subagent).
