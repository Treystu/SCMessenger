# 2026-06-08 02:38 PT — Orchestrator Live Status

**Mode:** Hermes as Orchestrator (Overseer role, 3rd slot, persistent, no
count toward 2-worker limit). 2 cloud worker slots active.

**Authority:** Lucas directive 2026-06-08 ~02:00 PT: "take over as
orchestrator, simply never launch more than 2 simultaneous 'ollama launch
claude' commands."

## Live Slot State

| Slot | PID | Model | Task | Status | Started | Budget |
|------|-----|-------|------|--------|---------|--------|
| 2 | 10824 | qwen3-coder-next:cloud | P1_ANDROID_IdentityCreationFlow | editing source + new file | 02:22 PT | 30 min |
| 1 (replacement) | 23676 | qwen3-coder-next:cloud | P1_ANDROID_023_History_Persistence | building test infra | 02:34 PT | 20 min |

**Slot 1 (PID 648, in-band Claude Code) was RELEASED at 02:34 PT** —
finished 7-phase sweep cleanly:
- 5 commits: 340b4034 (unified backlog), d630d543 (results SHA), 0981ebfd (DM), 73bd329f (sweep done), 404ba9a8 (line-ending)
- 48 files / 1815 insertions
- Branch: `integration/v0.2.2-pre-android-push-2026-06-05`
- No push per Lucas's gate
- See `HANDOFF/STATE/2026-06-08_SWEEP_RESULTS.md` for full details

## Pre-staged Next Prompts (in dispatch queue)

| # | Ticket | Path | Model | Budget | Blocking |
|---|--------|------|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | P1_CLI_026 External_Address_Omits_LAN_Interface | `tmp/work_files/agent_slot1_prompt_cli_026_external_address.md` | qwen3-coder-next:cloud | 600s | Windows/Ubuntu E2E |
| 2 | P1_CLI_024 mDNS_TxtRecordTooLong_For_Circuit | (not yet authored) | qwen3-coder-next:cloud | 1200s | — |
| 3 | P1_CLI_025 Identify_Protocol_Spam_From_Relay_Peer | (not yet authored) | qwen3-coder-next:cloud | 1200s | — |
| 4 | P1_VERIFY_Windows_WSL_CLI_Discovery_Messaging_E2E | (not yet authored) | qwen3-coder-next:cloud or deepseek-v4-pro:cloud | 1800s | Phase 3 green |

## Model Selection Logic

Per `.claude/model_capability_mapping.json` (46 models, 41 cloud, 5 local):
- **Kotlin/Compose code (Android workers)** → `qwen3-coder-next:cloud` (80b, code completion, balanced)
- **Rust/core/transport code (CLI workers)** → `qwen3-coder-next:cloud` (good for Rust too, faster than glm-5.1:cloud 1.5T)
- **Crypto/security P0** → `deepseek-v3.2:cloud` (precision_validator, recommended for P0_crypto)
- **Code review/merge gates** → `kimi-k2-thinking:cloud` (1T deep_reviewer)
- **Cross-platform E2E / orchestration** → `mistral-large-3:675b:cloud` or `deepseek-v3.1:671b:cloud`

Local models (5) are reserved for trivial/micro tasks only per Lucas's
"local LLM doesn't count as a slot but use it only if proven" directive.

## Quota

- 5h: 20.9% (TIER 1 HEAVY-LIFT, 180 min to reset)
- 7d: 12.2%
- Cloud budget: plenty for 5-10 more dispatches

## Self-Report Gate (enforced)

Every worker must:
1. Verify build artifacts with `Test-Path` + `Get-Item .Length` (PowerShell) or `os.path.exists() + os.path.getsize()` (Rust)
2. `git mv` ticket to `HANDOFF/done/` before claiming done
3. No silent retries
4. No push (local commits only)
5. No edits to canonical docs unless behavior change is documented in the ticket

## Polling Cadence

Every 3-5 min I check:
- `tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq claude.exe"` — should always show 2 workers
- `git status` — see what files are in flight
- `git log --oneline -5` — new commits
- Worker CPU time — deltas to detect stall vs progress
- `tmp/work_logs/agent_*.log` — any output captured

On halt/failure, I report to Lucas via Telegram and stop the affected slot.

## Outstanding Blockers (carryover from sweep)

1. **3 cargo test failures in `desktop_bridge` xdg_paths_test** (Windows vs Linux XDG path assertions) — pre-existing, not fixed
2. **21 Android test failures in 4 MockK test classes** (ContactsViewModelTest, SettingsViewModelTest, ui.viewmodels.ContactsViewModelTest, MeshServiceViewModelTest) — pre-existing, post-`23174061` API names not propagated
3. **CLI HTTP smoke test fails on Windows** (Warp server binds 0.0.0.0:19201 but port not externally reachable) — likely Windows Defender/firewall
4. **Pixel 6a OFFLINE** — mDNS verification blocked on hardware reattach

## Next Decisions Needed From Lucas

1. **Should I attempt to fix the 21 Android MockK test failures** as a follow-up dispatch, or leave them as known-pre-existing?
2. **Should I attempt the CLI HTTP smoke test Windows networking issue** (debug Warp bind/reachability)?
3. **APK version bump** (versionCode → 8, versionName → 0.2.2) — only if Lucas confirms this is the intended release line.
