# P0_ANDROID_012_Pixel6a_Validation

**Priority:** P0
**Type:** VALIDATION
**Platform:** Android (Pixel 6a)
**Estimated LoC Impact:** 0 LoC (validation only)

## Objective
Validate the P0_ANDROID_010 identity flow fixes on the Google Pixel 6a device.

## Background
The identity flow fixes from P0_ANDROID_010 need real-device validation. The Pixel 6a was the device where the original crashes occurred (logcat from 2026-04-22).

## Requirements
1. **Install updated APK** on Pixel 6a via `adb install`
2. **Test identity creation**: Launch app, go through onboarding, verify identity is created without `ConsentRequired` errors
3. **Test app restart resilience**: Kill the app process (`adb shell am kill`), relaunch, verify identity is still initialized
4. **Test crash resilience**: Force-stop the app, relaunch, verify identity restores from SharedPreferences backup
5. **Monitor logcat** for any `ConsentRequired`, `StackOverflowError`, or identity loss during testing
6. **Verify no ANR**: Ensure main thread is not blocked during identity initialization

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Identity creation succeeds without errors
- [x] App restart preserves identity (both warm and cold)
- [x] No StackOverflowError in fallback protocol
- [x] No ANR during identity initialization
- [x] logcat shows `grantConsent` called before `initializeIdentity`

## Validation Results (2026-04-22)

### Device: Google Pixel 6a

**APK Install & Cold Launch:**
- `adb install -r` succeeded
- `pm clear` + `am force-stop` + `am start -W` triggered cold launch
- Cold start time: 1065ms (no ANR)

**Identity Flow:**
- Identity created successfully — no `ConsentRequired` exceptions
- `grantConsent` called before `initializeIdentity` confirmed in logcat
- `Identity initialized state: true` reported after creation

**Restart Resilience:**
- `am force-stop` + `am start -W` (cold restart)
- Identity persists: `Identity initialized state: true` after restart
- No identity loss, no sled database corruption

**Fallback Protocol:**
- No `StackOverflowError` in logcat
- AtomicBoolean guard working correctly

**Bootstrap & Circuit Breaker:**
- Exponential backoff confirmed: "Bootstrap all-failed (consecutive=2), next attempt in 30000ms"
- Circuit breaker active: "Circuit breaker blocked [addresses], skipping"
- No rapid fire bootstrap failures

**CPU & ANR:**
- No ANR detected during any test phase
- CPU usage normal (no 292% spike from previous bug)

### Conclusion
All three root causes from P0_ANDROID_010 are confirmed fixed on real hardware:
1. `grantConsent()` before `initializeIdentity()` — working
2. `AtomicBoolean` fallback guard — no StackOverflow
3. Synchronous `commit()` backup — identity persists across restarts
