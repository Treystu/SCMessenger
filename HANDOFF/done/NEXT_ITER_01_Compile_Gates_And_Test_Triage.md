# NEXT_ITER_01: Run All Compile Gates + Android Unit Test Triage

**Priority:** P0 (gates the Fable 5 stabilization sprint commit chain)
**Recommended worker:** sonnet (mechanical triage with judgment); haiku is fine if the gates just pass
**Source:** Fable 5 session 2026-07-05/06 handoff (operator directive: hand compile
gates to cheaper workers, re-escalate to Fable only as needed)

## Context

The Fable 5 networking/stabilization sprint (see `HANDOFF/done/FABLE_5_COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT.md`,
or `HANDOFF/todo/` if not yet moved) landed large changes:

- `core/src/transport/swarm.rs` — ListenerFailed event variant + gossipsub reply channels
- `core/src/mobile_bridge.rs` — 14 sync FFI fns converted to `async fn` (UniFFI suspend), startup-await in `start_swarm`
- `android/.../MeshRepository.kt` and 8 other Kotlin files — suspend conversions, dedicated dispatchers
- `android/app/build.gradle` — unit tests RE-ENABLED (operator-approved reversal of the 2026-06-06 disable)
- 4 tests in `MeshRepositoryTest.kt` wrapped in `runTest` for the now-suspend `attemptWifiThenBleFallback`

Already verified when this handoff was written: `cargo check --workspace` PASS,
`cargo fmt --all -- --check` PASS, `cargo check -p scmessenger-core` PASS.

## Your job

Run each gate below IN ORDER. Windows notes: run from Git Bash
(`"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"`), and `export CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` first.
Never run two cargo/gradle builds concurrently.

1. `cargo build --workspace` — must pass.
2. `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings -A clippy::empty_line_after_doc_comments` — must pass.
   Mechanical fixes (unused imports, needless borrows) you may fix directly.
3. `cargo test --workspace --no-run` — the compile gate. Test-code compile
   errors from renamed helpers (e.g. `get_peers` -> `get_peers_blocking` in
   `core/src/mobile_bridge.rs` tests) are yours to fix mechanically.
4. `cargo test --workspace` — run the suite. Pre-existing failures (verify via
   `git stash` + rerun if unsure) get documented, not silently fixed.
5. `cargo check -p scmessenger-wasm --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` — must pass.
   Watch for: UniFFI 0.31 async exports on wasm32 (the 14 new `async fn` in
   mobile_bridge.rs compile under the `wasm-unstable-single-threaded` feature —
   if this errors, that is an ESCALATION, not a mechanical fix).
6. `cd android && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug :app:testDebugUnitTest -x lint`
   — the unit test suite was re-enabled after a month disabled.
   TRIAGE STATE AT HANDOFF (2026-07-06, Fable session):
   - Main source compiles; `assembleDebug` PASSES.
   - `ConversationsViewModelTest.kt` fixed in-session (MessageRecord gained a
     `status` param).
   - `MeshRepositoryTest.kt` fixed in-session (4 tests wrapped in `runTest`
     for the now-suspend `attemptWifiThenBleFallback`).
   - TWO drifted files were QUARANTINED to `android/app/src/test-quarantine/`
     (not a source set; see its README.md for the exact drift inventory):
     `IdentityViewModelTest.kt` (ViewModel moved packages + gained an
     identityCreationCoordinator dependency; needs rework against current API)
     and `IdentityCreationFlowTest.kt` (Compose UI test in the JVM unit-test
     source set — has never compiled here; needs androidTest move or
     Robolectric+compose-test deps — a structural decision).
     YOUR JOB: restore both — fix them against current APIs, move them back
     into a compiling source set, and delete the quarantine dir when empty.
   - FIRST REAL RUN RESULT (2026-07-06): **101 tests completed, 94 passed,
     7 failed, 2 skipped.** `RoleNavigationPolicyTest` (the mandatory
     pre-merge gate): 3/3 PASS. Additional in-session mechanical fixes:
     ChatViewModelTest/ContactsViewModelTest/MockTestHelper/UniffiIntegrationTest
     (MessageRecord.status + Contact.verifiedAt/isTombstone constructor drift),
     AndroidPlatformBridgeTest (bogus `io.mockk.isNull` top-level import removed).
   - THE 7 REMAINING FAILURES to triage (none look like sprint regressions —
     the repository is mocked in all of them, so the Rust/FFI changes are
     not in play):
     a) `AndroidPlatformBridgeTest > battery broadcast onReceive returns
        promptly despite slow FFI call` — InvocationTargetException at
        test line 41 (`registerBatteryMonitor.invoke(bridge)`); this test was
        added by the /scmorc BatteryReceiver-ANR session while tests were
        force-disabled and has NEVER executed — the reflection target throws a
        RuntimeException against the mocked Context. Get the full stack from
        `android/app/build/reports/tests/testDebugUnitTest/` and fix the test
        harness (likely un-stubbed Context/registerReceiver overload), or the
        production registerBatteryMonitor if it's a real bug.
     b) `SettingsViewModelTest` — all 6 tests NPE at test line 80
        (`viewModel = SettingsViewModel(...)` construction). The ViewModel's
        init drifted against the test's mock setup (note the test does NOT stub
        `repository.identityInfo`, which init collects). Fix the mock setup
        against the current SettingsViewModel init.
   - For any further failures you cause or find: if the test asserts old
     behavior that the sprint intentionally changed (e.g. dial is now
     fire-and-forget via repoScope, startSwarm now blocks until listener
     bind), update the test with a comment; if the test catches a real
     regression, escalate with the failure output. Do NOT delete, @Ignore,
     or quarantine further tests to make the build green.
   - Watch `UniffiIntegrationTest.kt` specifically: if it fails to load the
     native library in the JVM test context, that is plausibly the original
     (undocumented) reason tests were disabled in June — document it and
     escalate rather than hacking around it.

## Completion criteria

- All 6 gates pass (or failures are documented with root-cause notes in this file).
- Update this file with per-gate PASS/FAIL + notes, move it to `HANDOFF/done/`.
- Commit: `native: completed NEXT_ITER_01_Compile_Gates_And_Test_Triage`.

## Escalate to Fable (do not attempt) if

- Any wasm32 UniFFI async export failure (may require re-architecting the FFI surface).
- Main-source Kotlin/Rust compile errors that need design decisions.
- A unit test failure that looks like a genuine behavioral regression from the sprint.
