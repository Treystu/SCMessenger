## Verified Finding

The file `HANDOFF/todo/BATCH_P1_CORE_MYCO_ROUTING.md` is stale. It was completed on 2026-05-18 (commit `8a49c3ac`) when the Mycorrhizal Routing engine was verified as already fully active in the production send path.

**Verification:**
- `core/src/iron_core.rs:516-518`  `OptimizedRoutingEngine` initialized at identity creation
- `core/src/transport/swarm.rs:3666-3716`  `SwarmCommand::SendMessage` calls `engine.route_message_optimized()`
- `core/tests/integration_mycorrhizal_routing.rs`  14 integration tests prove active routing
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` updated with verification details
- `REMAINING_WORK_TRACKING.md` updated

## Required Action

1. Delete `HANDOFF/todo/BATCH_P1_CORE_MYCO_ROUTING.md`
2. No code changes required
3. No build verification required
4. No documentation updates required

## Acceptance Gate

- `HANDOFF/todo/BATCH_P1_CORE_MYCO_ROUTING.md` no longer exists
- `git add -A && git commit -m "swarm: completed cleanup stale BATCH_P1_CORE_MYCO_ROUTING"`
