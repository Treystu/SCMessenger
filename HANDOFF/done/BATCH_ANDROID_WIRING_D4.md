# BATCH: Android UI + ViewModel + Transport Wiring (D4)

You are a worker implementing wiring tasks. Each task requires you to:
1. Find the target function
2. Identify where it should be called
3. Wire it into the production call path
4. Verify compilation with `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug -x lint --quiet`
5. Move the task file from HANDOFF/todo/ to HANDOFF/done/

CRITICAL: You are forbidden from considering a task 'complete' until you execute the mv or Rename-Item command to move the task markdown file from todo/ (or IN_PROGRESS/) to done/. If you do not move the file, the Orchestrator assumes you failed.

## Build Verification
After wiring, run: `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug -x lint --quiet`

## Execution Strategy

Work through groups A → B → C → D in order. After each group, run `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug -x lint --quiet` to verify compilation. Fix any errors before moving to the next group.

When all groups are complete and compilation passes, move ALL completed task files from `HANDOFF/todo/` to `HANDOFF/done/`.

## Important Notes
- Use Hilt DI (@Inject) for all dependency injection
- All user-facing strings go in strings.xml
- Compose UI components should be added to NavHost or called from parent composables
- MeshRepository is the central hub; all ViewModel access goes through it
- Foreground service must set up notification channel for Android 14+
