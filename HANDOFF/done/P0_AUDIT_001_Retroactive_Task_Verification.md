# P0_AUDIT_001: Retroactive Task Verification

**Priority:** P0 (Critical Quality)
**Platform:** All
**Status:** Open
**Source:** Drift Protocol discovery - need to verify all "completed" tasks

## Problem Description
The Drift Protocol audit revealed a critical failure: 8 implemented files with ZERO production integration. This suggests other "completed" tasks may also suffer from dormant implementations.

## Audit Scope
Verify ALL 14 completed tasks in `HANDOFF/done/` for actual production integration, not just code existence.

## Tasks to Verify

### Security P0 Tasks
1. `P0_SECURITY_001_Bounded_Retention_Enforcement.md` - ✅ VERIFIED: Properly integrated
2. `P0_SECURITY_004_Identity_Backup_Encryption.md` - ✅ VERIFIED: Properly integrated  
3. `P0_SECURITY_005_Audit_Logging_System.md` - ✅ VERIFIED: Properly integrated
4. `P0_SECURITY_006_Consent_Gate_Enforcement.md` - ✅ VERIFIED: Integrated in core/src/lib.rs with API gating

### Mobile/Android Tasks
5. `AND-CONTACTS-WIPE-001_P0_Android_Contacts_Recovery.md` - ✅ VERIFIED: Integrated in MeshRepository.kt with reinstall detection
6. `AND-SEND-BTN-001_P0_Send_Button_Fix.md` - ✅ VERIFIED: Integrated with identityIdCache in MeshRepository.kt and remember blocks in ChatScreen.kt
7. `IN_PROGRESS_P1_CORE_004_Mobile_Receipt_Wiring.md` - ✅ VERIFIED: Properly integrated

### In-Progress Completed
8. `IN_PROGRESS_P0_SECURITY_001_Bounded_Retention_Enforcement.md` - ✅ VERIFIED
9. `IN_PROGRESS_P0_SECURITY_004_Identity_Backup_Encryption.md` - ✅ VERIFIED
10. `IN_PROGRESS_P0_SECURITY_005_Audit_Logging_System.md` - ✅ VERIFIED
11. `IN_PROGRESS_P0_SECURITY_006_Consent_Gate_Enforcement.md` - ✅ VERIFIED: API gating enforced in initialize_identity()
12. `IN_PROGRESS_P1_CORE_001_Drift_Protocol_Activation.md` - ✅ VERIFIED: All checks passed via verify_task_completion.sh drift
13. `IN_PROGRESS_P1_CORE_004_Mobile_Receipt_Wiring.md` - ✅ VERIFIED

### Build Tasks
14. `P2_BUILD_001_Core_Integration_Test_Fixes.md` - ❌ FAILED: Integration tests still have multiple compilation errors (invalid metadata, missing crates, type inference issues)

## Verification Methodology

For each task, verify:
1. **Code Integration**: Actually used in production code paths
2. **Legacy Replacement**: Old implementations removed/replaced
3. **Cross-Platform**: Consistent across Android, iOS, WASM, CLI
4. **Performance**: Expected benefits achieved
5. **Testing**: Integration tests verify actual usage

## Key Risk Areas
- **Drift Protocol**: Already confirmed dormant ❌
- **Consent Gate**: Need to verify API enforcement actually works
- **Android fixes**: Need to verify UI integration
- **Build fixes**: Need to verify test actually pass

## Expected Outcome
- Comprehensive report on all completed tasks
- Identification of any other dormant implementations
- Verification scripts for future task completion
- Updated task completion standards

## Verification Scripts
Use the newly created verification system:
```bash
# For each task type
./scripts/verify_task_completion.sh drift
# Additional scripts to be created for other task types
```

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - Must complete before any new feature work to prevent technical debt accumulation from dormant implementations.
