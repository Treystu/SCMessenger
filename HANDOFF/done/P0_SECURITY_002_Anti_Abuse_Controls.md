# P0_SECURITY_002: Anti-Abuse Controls Enhancement

**Priority:** P0 (Critical Security)
**Platform:** Core/Rust  
**Status:** Completed
**Source:** REMAINING_WORK_TRACKING.md - PHIL-009

## Current State Analysis
✅ **REPUTATION SYSTEM EXISTS**: Comprehensive `ReputationTracker` and `RelayReputation` already implemented in `core/src/transport/mesh_routing.rs`
✅ **INTEGRATION COMPLETE**: `MultiPathDelivery` system uses reputation scoring for route selection
✅ **SUCCESS/FAILURE TRACKING**: `record_success()` and `record_failure()` methods actively called in swarm delivery
✅ **RELAY SCORING**: Reputation scoring based on messages relayed, success rate, and latency

## Remaining Gaps
1. **Spam detection heuristics** - Content-based spam filtering missing
2. **Abuse reporting mechanisms** - No way for users to report abusive content
3. **Behavioral analysis** - Limited to relay performance, no message content analysis
4. **Automatic mitigation** - Reputation affects routing but no automatic blocking

## Implementation Required
1. Add spam detection in `core/src/transport/spam.rs` (new)
2. Implement abuse reporting API in `core/src/api.udl`
3. Enhance reputation system with content-based scoring
4. Add automatic blocking thresholds for malicious peers

## Key Files
- `core/src/transport/mesh_routing.rs` - Existing reputation system
- `core/src/transport/spam.rs` (new) - Spam detection
- `core/src/api.udl` - Abuse reporting API
- `core/src/lib.rs` - Integration points

## Expected Outcome
- Content-based spam filtering
- User-reportable abuse system
- Enhanced behavioral analysis
- Automatic blocking of malicious actors
