## Triage Decision -- 2026-06-11

**Status:** ready
**Bucket:** pending-dispatch
**Cross-ref:** `HANDOFF/ACTIVE_LEDGER.md` line 14 (1 warning, no callers)
**Decided by:** Hermes Agent (overseer) post-session audit
**Routing model:** `gemini-3.5-flash:cloud` (1-line Rust delete)
**Rationale:** Per ACTIVE_LEDGER.md line 14: "Warnings: 1  unused import `std::sync::Arc` in `wasm/src/transport.rs:17`". The warning has been there since 2026-05-13. Pure 1-line fix: delete the import. Trivial, ships in 60 seconds. Phase A.3 from the plan, the easiest of all 4 P0_BUILD items.

# P1_GEMINI_FLASH_012  Remove Unused Arc Import in WASM Transport

**Status:** VERIFIED REMAINING WORK
**Agent:** gemini-coder (Gemini 3.5 Flash)
**Budget:** 300s (MICRO tier)
**Phase:** v0.2.1 P0  Gate restoration (A.3)
**Source:** `HANDOFF/ACTIVE_LEDGER.md` 2026-05-13 (the only warning in the workspace)
**Depends on:** none
**Blocks:** A.1, A.2 (cascade warnings)

## Verified Gap

`wasm/src/transport.rs:17` imports `std::sync::Arc` but doesn't use it. The warning has been present in every `cargo check --workspace` run since 2026-05-13. Per the 6-tier governor, this is a P0/quick-win fix that any tier can land.

## Scope (~1 LoC, 1 file)

In `wasm/src/transport.rs`:
- Line 17: `use std::sync::Arc;`  delete

If other unused imports exist in the same file, delete those too (probably not  ACTIVE_LEDGER only flagged Arc).

## File Targets

- `wasm/src/transport.rs` [EDIT  delete 1 line]

## Build Verification

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Github/SCMessenger
cargo check --workspace 2>&1 | tee /tmp/check-$(date +%s).log
# Should report 0 warnings
grep "warning:" /tmp/check-$(date +%s).log | head -5  # should be empty
```

## Acceptance Gates

1. `cargo check --workspace` reports 0 warnings
2. `git diff` shows ONLY the deleted `use` line
3. No new errors introduced (cascade check)

## CRITICAL

You are forbidden from considering this task 'complete' until you execute the `git mv` to move this file from `todo/` to `done/`. If you do not move the file, the Orchestrator assumes you failed.

## /scm closure note (native, 2026-07-03)
Verified: no unused `std::sync::Arc` import remains at wasm/src/transport.rs:17 or anywhere in the file (grep found only usages inside `Arc<RwLock<>>` types/comments). Already fixed prior to this run. Moved todo -> done, no code change needed.
