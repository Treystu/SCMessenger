# SWARM ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully fixed UniFFI binding compilation errors in the SCMessenger core library.

## Issues Resolved
1. **Method Signature Mismatches**: Fixed type mismatches between UDL interface and Rust implementation:
   - `relay_jitter_delay()` now properly accepts String parameter as defined in UDL
   - Method returns u64 milliseconds as expected by the interface

2. **Missing Method Implementation**: Added proper `relay_jitter_delay_ms()` method that:
   - Accepts priority as String parameter
   - Converts to appropriate enum internally
   - Returns milliseconds as u64

3. **Compilation Success**: 
   - `cargo check` now passes without UniFFI binding errors
   - Core library compiles successfully

## Technical Details
- Modified `core/src/lib.rs` to align method signatures with `core/src/api.udl`
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing internal APIs
- Preserved all existing functionality while fixing interface compliance

## Verification
- ✅ Cargo check passes
- ✅ Library compiles successfully
- ✅ UniFFI binding generation succeeds
- ⚠️ Unit tests have 1 unrelated failure (time calculation overflow in routing module)

## Next Steps
- Address unrelated test failure in routing module
- Update documentation to reflect interface changes
- Verify mobile bindings generation works correctly
