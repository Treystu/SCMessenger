# SCMessenger CLI Daemon Smoke Test Results

**Date:** 2026-04-23
**Tester:** CLIBetaTester
**Test Status:** Partial Success

## Summary

The SCMessenger CLI daemon is running and responding to HTTP requests, but there are issues with WebSocket connectivity and peer discovery.

## Findings

1. **Daemon Health:**
   - Process is running (PID: 23128)
   - HTTP server is responding on port 9000
   - Serving web interface successfully
   - Log shows active dialing of 114 known peers

2. **WebSocket Issues:**
   - WebSocket connection attempts to ws://127.0.0.1:9000/ws are failing
   - Error in logs: "WsOriginRejected"
   - Python-based RPC calls are failing due to Python path issues on Windows

3. **Peer Discovery:**
   - Daemon is actively dialing 114 peers in promiscuous mode
   - No successful connections established based on log analysis
   - QUIC listener binding failed with Multiaddr not supported error

4. **Configuration Issues:**
   - Python path issues on Windows preventing proper RPC testing
   - Fixed core_cli_driver.sh to use explicit Python path

## Recommendations

1. Investigate WebSocket origin rejection issue
2. Check QUIC listener configuration
3. Improve cross-platform compatibility for Python scripts
4. Review peer discovery and connection logic

## Next Steps

Further testing requires fixing WebSocket connectivity issues to properly test messaging functionality.
