# TASK [MEDIUM]: Skipped ratchet keys don't survive session persistence

Status: DONE 2026-07-13. Added `skipped_keys` to `SerializableRatchetSession`
(hex-encoded `Vec<(String, u32, String)>`, `#[serde(default)]` so pre-existing
persisted sessions without it still deserialize), a `skipped_keys_snapshot()`
accessor on `RatchetSession`, and threaded real values through
`reconstruct()`/`into_session()` instead of the hardcoded `HashMap::new()`.
Regression test `test_skipped_keys_survive_persistence_roundtrip` (in
`session_manager.rs`) proves a skipped key survives the full
from_session -> serialize -> into_session round trip. Full crypto:: suite
(75 tests) + workspace check green.

**Security tradeoff decision:** persisting message keys to disk is accepted
as-is, not WONTFIX - the session store's own doc comment already states the
caller must ensure storage is encrypted at rest, so this doesn't create a new
exposure class beyond what the rest of the persisted session (DH secrets,
root key) already accepts. Reversing this (losing skipped keys on every
restart) would cause real, silent message loss for any legitimately-delayed
message - worse than the marginal persistence-window extension.

Found 2026-07-12 during the PQC-05/06/07 adversarial review
checkpoint (`HANDOFF/review/PQC_05_06_07_ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW.md`), confirmed
by direct source read (not just the reviewing model's claim).

## The gap

`RatchetSession::reconstruct` (`core/src/crypto/ratchet.rs:158-185`) has no
`skipped_keys` parameter at all, and unconditionally initializes it as
`HashMap::new()` (line 185). `core/src/crypto/session_manager.rs` never
mentions `skipped_keys` anywhere (zero grep hits) — it was never added to
the persisted session format in the first place, so this isn't a case of
`reconstruct` discarding stored data; the data simply never gets that far.

## Why it matters

`skipped_keys` holds message keys for out-of-order messages the ratchet
has already advanced past (`ratchet.rs:610,631-636`, capped at
`MAX_SKIP_KEYS`). Every time a session gets persisted and reloaded (process
restart, app backgrounding on mobile, etc.), any key currently held there is
permanently lost. A message that was legitimately delayed in transit and
arrives after the reload will have no matching skipped key to decrypt with
and gets treated as behind the current chain position -- a real message
silently becomes undeliverable, not because of a transport bug but because
of this persistence gap.

## Fix direction

1. Add `skipped_keys` to whatever the serialized session-state format is in
   `session_manager.rs` (need to check the actual struct that gets
   `serde_json`'d for persistence -- this ticket doesn't yet know its name;
   first step is finding it via `rg -n "struct.*Session.*Serialize|derive.*Serialize" core/src/crypto/session_manager.rs`).
2. Add a `skipped_keys` parameter to `reconstruct` and restore it from the
   persisted value instead of hardcoding `HashMap::new()`.
3. Consider whether skipped key MATERIAL should be persisted at all from a
   security-hygiene standpoint (message keys are sensitive; persisting them
   to disk extends their exposure window) vs. accepting the current
   behavior (lose them on restart) as an intentional security/availability
   tradeoff -- if the latter, this ticket should be closed as WONTFIX with
   that reasoning recorded, not silently ignored. Escalate this specific
   tradeoff question to the operator if genuinely unsure; don't guess.
4. Add a regression test: skip a message (advance the ratchet past it),
   persist + reconstruct the session, then decrypt the skipped message and
   confirm it still succeeds.

## Gate

Touches `core/src/crypto/` -- mandatory adversarial review before merge per
`.claude/rules/security.md`, same as any ratchet/session-state change.
