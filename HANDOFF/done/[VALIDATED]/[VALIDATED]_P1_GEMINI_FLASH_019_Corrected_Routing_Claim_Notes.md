## Triage Decision -- 2026-06-11

**Status:** ready
**Bucket:** pending-dispatch
**Cross-ref:** `HANDOFF/STATE/PLAN_VERIFICATION_2026-06-11.md` Bottom Line (most-wrong claim: Mycorrhizal Routing)
**Decided by:** Hermes Agent (overseer) post-session audit
**Routing model:** `gemini-3.5-flash:cloud` (markdown + table updates, no logic)
**Rationale:** Per verification, the plan's claim "Mycorrhizal Routing is dormant" is wrong  it's actually active. But this stale claim is also cited in `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` and `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` and `docs/UNIFIED_GLOBAL_APP_PLAN.md`. Each doc needs a `[CORRECTED 2026-06-11]` note pointing to the verification doc. ~30 LoC total across 3 docs. Pure markdown. Trivial for Flash.

## Verified Gap

The stale claim "Mycorrhizal Routing is dormant / architected-but-not-active" appears in:
- `HANDOFF/plans/planfromclaudeforhermes.md` 2 (claim)  needs correction
- `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md`  likely same claim
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`  already updated 2026-05-18 but may not have the latest pointer

Reality: routing is **active** in the production send path. Per `swarm.rs:3970` + `core/src/routing/optimized_engine.rs` + integration tests at `core/tests/integration_mycorrhizal_routing.rs` (567 lines, 14 tests, all green).

## Scope (~30 LoC across 3 files)

### Part A: `HANDOFF/plans/planfromclaudeforhermes.md` (LOC: ~15)

Find any text saying "Mycorrhizal Routing dormant" or similar. Add a footnote-style correction:

```markdown
> **CORRECTION (2026-06-11):** Mycorrhizal Routing is **active in production** as of 2026-05-18, not dormant. See `STATE/PLAN_VERIFICATION_2026-06-11.md` 3 and `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` 2026-05-18 entry. Wiring target remains: full multipath + reputation + negative cache adoption (Phase C.2 in the plan).
```

### Part B: `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` (LOC: ~10)

Same correction, similar format.

### Part C: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` (LOC: ~5)

Verify the 2026-05-18 entry explicitly states routing is active. If not, add a `[verified 2026-06-11]` note.

## File Targets

- `HANDOFF/plans/planfromclaudeforhermes.md` [EDIT  correction note, ~15 LoC]
- `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` [EDIT  correction note, ~10 LoC]
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` [EDIT  verify + note if needed, ~5 LoC]

## Build Verification

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Github/SCMessenger
grep -n "Mycorrhizal Routing" HANDOFF/plans/planfromclaudeforhermes.md | head -3
grep -n "CORRECTION" HANDOFF/plans/planfromclaudeforhermes.md
grep -n "Mycorrhizal" PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md | head -3
```

## Acceptance Gates

1. `HANDOFF/plans/planfromclaudeforhermes.md` has at least one `CORRECTION (2026-06-11)` note
2. `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` has at least one such note
3. `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` either already has the 2026-05-18 entry or gets a `[verified 2026-06-11]` note added
4. `git diff` shows only the 3 corrections; no other content changed
