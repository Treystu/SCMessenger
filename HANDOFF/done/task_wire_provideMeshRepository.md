SYSTEM DIRECTIVE: COMPREHENSIVE DEAD-END RESOLUTION
The function 'provideMeshRepository' is defined in 'android\app\src\main\java\com\scmessenger\android\di\AppModule.kt' but is NEVER called anywhere in the repository. Your job is to fully integrate it into the overarching application loop. It may need to be wired into 1, 2, or 3+ different locations.

================================================================================
INTEGRATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

ANALYSIS:
---------
The 'provideMeshRepository' function in AppModule.kt is a Hilt dependency
injection provider method. It is annotated with @Provides and @Singleton,
and is installed in SingletonComponent. While not explicitly called in source
code, it is automatically invoked by Hilt's generated code when components
need a MeshRepository instance.

WIRING VERIFICATION:
--------------------
MeshRepository is properly injected into the following classes:
- AndroidPlatformBridge
- TopicManager
- ContactsViewModel
- ChatViewModel
- ConversationsViewModel
- DashboardViewModel
- IdentityViewModel
- SettingsViewModel
- MainViewModel
- MeshServiceViewModel
- MainActivity
- MeshForegroundService

All these classes have MeshRepository as a constructor parameter or @Inject
field, which means Hilt automatically calls provideMeshRepository() to provide
the dependency.

The provideMeshRepository function is properly configured:
- Annotated with @Provides and @Singleton
- In a @Module that's @InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
- Takes @ApplicationContext as a parameter
- Returns MeshRepository instance
