# Agent Task: Android Gradle Build Verification

**Model:** gemma4:31b:cloud (lightweight)
**Priority:** P1 — Needed for Android deployment

## Context
The SCMessenger Android build needs verification. The core Rust crate compiles cleanly (`cargo check --workspace` passes). The build.gradle already has the GNU target fix for UniFFI binding generation.

## Steps

1. Set environment: `export ANDROID_HOME="$LOCALAPPDATA/Android/Sdk"`
2. Run: `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug -x lint --quiet`
3. If the build fails, read the error output and fix the issue
4. Key known issues:
   - If `cargo ndk` fails, check that `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` points to the NDK dir
   - If `dlltool` is not found, set `PATH="/c/msys64/mingw64/bin:$PATH"` before building
   - If UniFFI binding generation fails, the build.gradle already uses `--target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
5. On success, report the APK path and size

## File Domains
- `android/app/build.gradle`
- `android/app/src/`
- `android/build.gradle`

## Evidence Log (Orchestrator)

**Status: RESOLVED**
**Date: 2026-05-01**
**Agent: Master Orchestrator (kimi-k2.6:cloud)**

### Verification Results

| Command | Status | Output |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `cd android && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug --rerun-tasks -x lint` | **PASS** (exit 0, 8m 14s, 46 tasks executed) | APK produced: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` (29,756,445 bytes). cargo-ndk cross-compilation succeeded under MSVC Build Tools v143. |

### Notes
- Verified as part of `task_fix_windows_linker.md` (P0 infrastructure restore). Android build is unblocked and functional.
- `ANDROID_HOME` was not explicitly set in environment but Gradle auto-detected the Android SDK path.

### Review Gate
- [ ] Wiring-verifier approval required before moving to `done/`.
