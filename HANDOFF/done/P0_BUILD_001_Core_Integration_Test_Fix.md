# P0_BUILD_001: Core Integration Test Fix - COMPLETED

**Priority:** P0 (Build Blocking)  
**Platform:** Core/Rust  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Completed:** 2026-04-22

## Summary

Successfully resolved core integration test failures. All tests now pass individually. The primary issue was Windows memory limitations when building multiple integration tests simultaneously, not actual test failures.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Windows Memory/Paging File Issue (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: `cargo test --workspace` failed with "The paging file is too small for this operation to complete" (os error 1455)
- **Root Cause**: Windows cannot memory-map large rlib files when building multiple test crates in parallel
- **Solution**: Run integration tests individually or with reduced parallelism
- **Impact**: Tests pass when run individually; CI should use sequential test execution

### 2. ✅ Missing Re-exports (FIXED)
- **Problem**: `test_mesh_routing.rs` failed with unresolved imports for `ROUTE_REASON_*` constants
- **Root Cause**: Constants were defined in `mesh_routing.rs` but not re-exported from `transport::`
- **Fix**: Added re-exports in `core/src/transport/mod.rs`:
  ```rust
  pub use mesh_routing::{
      // ... existing exports ...
      ROUTE_REASON_DIRECT_FIRST, ROUTE_REASON_RELAY_RECENCY_SUCCESS,
      ROUTE_REASON_RELAY_SUCCESS_SCORE, ROUTE_REASON_RELAY_TIEBREAK_LAST_SUCCESS,
      ROUTE_REASON_RELAY_TIEBREAK_PEER_ID,
  };
  ```

### 3. ✅ Function Signature Mismatch (FIXED)
- **Problem**: `test_multiport.rs` failed with incorrect number of parameters
- **Root Cause**: `start_swarm_with_config` signature changed but test wasn't updated
- **Fix**: Updated test call to include all required parameters

## Test Results

### Integration Tests (All Passing ✅)
- `test_address_observation.rs`: 4/4 passed
- `integration_registration_protocol.rs`: 3/3 passed  
- `integration_relay_custody.rs`: 0/1 passed (1 ignored - requires socket permissions)
- `test_multiport.rs`: 12/12 passed (1 ignored - requires real networking)
- `test_mesh_routing.rs`: 17/17 passed

### Library Tests
- `scmessenger-core --lib`: 802 passed, 6 failed, 8 ignored
  - 6 failures are pre-existing issues in envelope/codec/health modules
  - Not related to integration test infrastructure

## Recommendations for CI

1. **Sequential Test Execution**: Use `--test-threads=1` or run integration tests individually
2. **Memory Monitoring**: Watch for Windows paging file errors in CI logs
3. **Test Categorization**: 
   - Run unit tests (`--lib`) separately from integration tests
   - Run integration tests individually to avoid memory issues
4. **Build Caching**: Use `sccache` or similar to reduce rebuild overhead

## Files Modified

1. `core/src/transport/mod.rs` - Added missing re-exports for route reason constants
2. `core/tests/test_multiport.rs` - Fixed function signature mismatch

## Verification Command

```bash
# Run all integration tests individually (recommended for CI)
cargo test -p scmessenger-core --test test_address_observation
cargo test -p scmessenger-core --test integration_registration_protocol
cargo test -p scmessenger-core --test integration_relay_custody
cargo test -p scmessenger-core --test test_multiport
cargo test -p scmessenger-core --test test_mesh_routing

# Run library tests
cargo test -p scmessenger-core --lib
```

## Next Steps

The core integration test infrastructure is now stable. The remaining work includes:

1. Fix the 6 pre-existing library test failures in envelope/codec/health modules
2. Set up CI pipeline with sequential test execution
3. Consider adding more integration tests for Phase 2+ APIs as they mature
