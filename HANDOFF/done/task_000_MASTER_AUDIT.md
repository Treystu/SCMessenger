# MASTER AUDIT — V-Gate Clearance & Backlog Integration

## Your Identity
You are a Tier 1 Auditor (`deepseek-v4-pro:cloud`, 1.6T params). You are NOT a coder. You do NOT write application code. Your sole job is to clear the Validation Gate so the Orchestrator can safely delegate to Tier 2/3 workers.

## V-Gate Status: TRIPPED

**Reason 1:** `HANDOFF/done/` contains ~150+ completed task files. Memory from these must be integrated into architecture docs and trackers before new work proceeds.

**Reason 2:** `HANDOFF/todo/` contains 3 files. NONE carry the `[VALIDATED]_` prefix required for worker dispatch.

## Your Mandate

### STEP 1: Ingest Done Backlog
Read a representative sample of ~25-30 completed task files from `HANDOFF/done/` spanning all domains (core, android, wasm, security, identity, transport, build). Prioritize:
- Files with `P0_` prefix (critical fixes)
- `FINAL_WIRING_AUDIT*.md`
- `phase_*` files (phase completion reports)
- `BATCH_*` files (batch wiring completions)

For each file read, extract: what was done, what files changed, what risks remain, what was deferred.

### STEP 2: Update Architecture Trackers
Based on done/ ingestion, update these files with current state:
- `REMAINING_WORK_TRACKING.md` — remove completed items, add newly discovered gaps
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` — update architecture description with verified state changes
- `docs/DOCUMENT_STATUS_INDEX.md` — mark any docs that need refresh

### STEP 3: Audit Todo Files
Evaluate each file in `HANDOFF/todo/` for:

**`task_epic_wiring_draft.md`:**
- Contains placeholder `[USER: INSERT YOUR PLANNING FILE NAMES HERE]` — NON-EXECUTABLE.
- Action: Either fill in the planning file names from the actual docs index, or mark as DEFERRED and move to a parking location. Do NOT validate a task with unresolved placeholders.

**`task_fire_drill_audit.md`:**
- Simple `git status` check. Trivial. Model assignment `gemma3:4b:cloud` is appropriate for TIER 4.
- Action: Validate if the git status check is still needed (check if repo state is clean/dirty from git log). If needed, add watchdog warning and rename to `[VALIDATED]_task_fire_drill_audit.md`.

**`ORCHESTRATOR_SESSION.md`:**
- This is NOT a task file. It is orchestration session documentation / a runbook.
- Action: Move to `HANDOFF/` root or `.claude/` as reference material. Do NOT validate as a task.

### STEP 4: Validate and Prefix
For every task you deem executable after audit:
1. Add the `[VALIDATED]_` prefix to the filename.
2. Ensure the task body contains the **Watchdog Warning** (see below).
3. Verify the Model field uses a model confirmed present in the dynamic roster with `:cloud` suffix.
4. Verify the Budget field is realistic for the task scope.

### STEP 5: Write Audit Report
Create `HANDOFF/done/task_000_MASTER_AUDIT_REPORT.md` containing:
- Summary of done/ backlog ingestion findings
- Architecture tracker updates made
- Todo audit results (what was validated, what was rejected, what was moved)
- Any newly discovered work items that need task files
- Confirmation that V-Gate is CLEARED

## Watchdog Warning Template
Every validated task MUST include this block verbatim:

```
## WATCHDOG WARNING
You are operating under a strict token budget as specified in the frontmatter Budget field.
An OS-level watchdog (TaskGovernor.ps1) is monitoring your debug logs.
If you exceed this budget, your process will be terminated immediately.
Optimize for minimal API calls. Batch your reads. Prefer targeted grep over full file reads.
```

## Rules
1. **NEVER write application code.** You are the auditor. You only read, analyze, and organize.
2. **NEVER modify code files.** Only touch: `HANDOFF/`, `REMAINING_WORK_TRACKING.md`, `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/DOCUMENT_STATUS_INDEX.md`.
3. **If you find a security-sensitive task,** flag it for `deepseek-v3.2:cloud` or `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` review in the task body.
4. **If a todo task is ambiguous or incomplete,** do NOT validate it. Move it to `HANDOFF/todo/REJECTED/` with a rejection note.
5. **On completion,** move THIS file to `HANDOFF/done/` and write your audit report.
