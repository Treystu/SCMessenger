# P0_SECURITY_005: Audit Logging System

**Priority:** P0 (Critical Security)
**Platform:** Core/Rust
**Status:** Completed
**Source:** REMAINING_WORK_TRACKING.md

## Problem Description
No audit logging - security events leave no tamper-evident trail. Cannot track security incidents or investigate breaches.

## Security Impact
- No record of security-related events
- Unable to investigate incidents
- No tamper-evident logging
- Compliance and forensic capabilities missing

## Implementation Required
1. Create audit logging framework in `core/src/audit/`
2. Implement tamper-evident log structure
3. Add critical event logging (auth, access, changes)
4. Create log rotation and retention policies

## Key Files
- `core/src/audit/mod.rs` (new)
- `core/src/audit/logger.rs` (new)
- Integration with existing security events

## Expected Outcome
- Comprehensive audit logging system
- Tamper-evident log records
- Security event tracking
- Forensic investigation capabilities
