**Status:** Awaiting Operator Sign-Off
**Priority:** P0 (Blocks transition to Phase 2)

## 1. Overview

This document serves as the official exit review and gateway control checklist for Phase 1 (Windows/Android transport parity). Transitioning to Phase 2 fine-planning and execution is frozen until this review is signed off by the operator.

---

## 2. Completed Milestones

All Phase 1 transport, core, and application milestones have been successfully implemented and verified:

*   **Compile Gates (P1-01, P1-02, NEXT_ITER_01)**
    *   Resolved `core/src/transport/swarm.rs` test-module broken imports.
    *   Added correct compilation guards (`#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`) on the desktop bridge BLE module for Windows compatibility.
    *   [OK] Workspace compiles cleanly (`cargo build --workspace`).
*   **mDNS Self-Loopback Filter (P1-06)**
    *   Filtered out the local node's own Peer ID from discovery results in `onLanPeerResolved` to prevent self-loopback dials on the Android target.
*   **Multi-Port Listen Ladder & Port Strategy (P1-10, P1-11, P1-12, P1-13)**
    *   Designed and implemented adaptive port allocation.
    *   Implemented fallback ladder listening mechanism and retired hardcoded references to port `9001`, `9002`, and `9010` in production files.
    *   Advertised dynamic listeners successfully over mDNS, peer exchange, and identify layers.
*   **Android DNS Crash Fix (ESC_ANDROID_DNS_RESOLVER_FIX)**
    *   Bypassed Android's missing `/etc/resolv.conf` Hickory DNS crash by initializing a custom DNS resolver configuration with Google Public DNS fallback servers.
*   **E2E Emulator-to-CLI Pairing (NEXT_ITER_04)**
    *   Successfully compiled, deployed, and ran the Android application on the AVD API 34 emulator (`scm_pixel_34`).
    *   Paired emulator and Windows CLI daemon over TCP loopback and ADB port-forwarding.
    *   Verified two-way messaging, identity/history sync, and message delivery receipts.

## 3. Confirmed Waivers

The following waivers have been formally recorded and approved for the Phase 1 exit:

*   **WiFi Direct Integration for Windows (P1-17 / P1_CORE_WINDOWS_WIFI_DIRECT_Peer_Absent)**
    *   [INFO] Status: WAIVED.
    *   [Rationale] Hardware restrictions prevent virtualizing WiFi Direct group owner capabilities on the local emulator. The matrix cell has been narrowed to Android-to-Android [BLOCKED-HW]. The Windows-to-Android equivalent path is successfully covered by mDNS/LAN discovery and local TCP sockets.
    *   [Resolution] Deferred to v1.1.
*   **BLE Peripheral Advertising on Windows CLI**
    *   [INFO] Status: COMPLETED.
    *   [Rationale] Native Windows BLE Peripheral Advertising and GATT Server mode (with Read Identity and Write/Notify Message characteristics) was implemented in `cli/src/ble_windows.rs` and integrated into the mesh network. Verified with clean compilation and full workspace test suite validation.

## 4. Exit Check Steps (Operator Actions)

The operator must perform the following manual checks before final approval:

*   [ ] **Git Working Tree Status**
    *   Verify `git status` shows no uncommitted files other than this exit review file and the updated queue.
*   [ ] **Documentation Sync Check**
    *   Run the documentation sync script:
        `"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" scripts/docs_sync_check.sh`
        (Or run the PowerShell equivalent if applicable)
    *   Verify the script completes with zero errors.
*   [ ] **Clean Build Verification**
    *   Free any stale build caches if needed, then run a full workspace verification:
        `export CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`
        `cargo clean`
        `cargo test --workspace`
    *   Verify all tests pass.
*   [ ] **Android App Compile**
    *   Run Android Gradle clean build to ensure Android targets are fully buildable:
        `./gradlew clean assembleDebug`
    *   Verify the APK compiles successfully.

## 5. Sign-off

Upon completion of the exit check steps, the operator may mark this task file as complete and move it to `HANDOFF/done/`. This action formally unfreezes the Phase 2 backlog.
