## Version bump files changed (5 files, 10 lines)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `Cargo.toml` | `[workspace.package].version` `0.2.1` → `0.3.0` (propagates to core/cli/mobile/desktop_bridge/wasm — all 5 inherit) |
| `android/build.gradle` | `versionCode` `7` → `8`; `versionName` `'0.2.1'` → `'0.3.0'` |
| `android/shared/build.gradle.kts` | `packageVersion` `"0.2.1"` → `"0.3.0"` |
| `iOS/SCMessenger/SCMessenger/Info.plist` | `CFBundleShortVersionString` `0.2.1` → `0.3.0`; `CFBundleVersion` `5` → `6` |
| `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` | "Version Details" block (lines 609-613): Current Version, GitHub Release URL, Android & iOS version stamps updated |

## Conflicts encountered

**None.** The integration branch had no commits ahead of `main` that the fix branch didn't already know about (the 5 SHAs in the prompt brief — 6e1c8494, 070f048a, etc. — were either on the fix branch tip or were intermediate integration commits, but they are all reachable from the fix branch tip; `git log fix..integration` returned empty). The `ort` merge was clean and 3-way automatic.

## Out-of-scope items NOT changed (intentionally)

- `REMAINING_WORK_TRACKING.md` — has no top-level "Current Version" line; the many `v0.2.1` mentions are historical record ("v0.2.1 Critical Bug Fixes (2026-03-12)", "Regressed from v0.2.1 to v0.1.9", etc.) and must not be falsified.
- `docs/historical/*` — per hard rules, untouched.
- `docs/MILESTONE_PLAN_V0.2.0_ALPHA.md` — historical doc, untouched.
- `docs/V0.2.1_*.md` (4 plan files) — named after the v0.2.1 version, treated as historical. Untouched.
- `HANDOFF/IN_PROGRESS/IN_PROGRESS_*` — active handoff state, untouched (this file is the only new IN_PROGRESS).
- `core/tests/integration_contact_block.rs`, `iOS_BUILD_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md`, `MASTER_BUG_TRACKER.md`, `iOS/SCMessenger/SCMessenger/Info.plist` source-build configs, `scripts/burndown_issues.sh` — all contain `0.2.1` references but are documentation/build context, not canonical version sources. Untouched.
- `Cargo.lock` — not present (no Rust lockfile committed in this repo; workspace lock is local).

## What was NOT run (per scope)

- `cargo check --workspace` — version bump only touched workspace.package.version + native packaging files; no Rust code changed. 411940d1 + 5a4132f0 already verified the Rust tree on the fix branch.
- `gradle` / `gradlew` — slot 3 is doing the APK verify.
- No test fixes attempted (24 pre-existing failures — separate task).

## Notes for Lucas

- Tag is at the MERGE commit (`0538224a`), not at the final release commit (`665a5199`). This is intentional: the merge commit is the meaningful "v0.3.0 point in history" with the P0/P1 bundle; the release commit is a paperwork version-bump commit on top. If you want the tag moved to `665a5199`, run `git tag -d v0.3.0 && git tag v0.3.9 -m "..." 665a5199` after review.
- `android/` uses Groovy `.gradle` (not `.kts` as the orchestrator brief mentioned). Root `android/build.gradle` is the canonical version source; `app/build.gradle` inherits via `rootProject.ext`.
- iOS version was bumped in lockstep (5→6) to keep the Android/iOS versionCode parity, since CURRENT_STATE.md documents them together.
