# Phase 1B: Core Module Wiring

**Priority:** P0
**Assigned Agent:** rust-coder (glm-5.1:cloud)
**Fallback:** architect (qwen3-coder:480b:cloud)
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Verified:** 2026-04-29
**Depends On:** phase_1a_compilation_baseline

## Objective
Ensure all core module handlers connect to IronCore and the module graph is complete.

## Module Wiring Checklist
- [x] Wire `transport/` — ensure all libp2p Swarm handlers connect to `IronCore`
- [x] Wire `drift/` — protocol framing, compression (lz4), relay custody, sync
- [x] Wire `routing/` — adaptive routing with TTL budgets, multipath, reputation
- [x] Wire `relay/` — bootstrap nodes, client/server, delegate prewarm, peer exchange
- [x] Wire `notification/` — classification and delivery policy
- [x] Wire `abuse/` — spam detection, reputation, auto-block
- [x] Wire `privacy/` — onion routing, cover traffic, padding, timing obfuscation

## Success Criteria
- [x] All modules have `pub fn` entry points callable from `IronCore`
- [x] No orphan modules — every module is wired into the main execution path
- [x] `cargo check --workspace` passes after wiring changes

## Rules
- All state behind `Arc<RwLock<...>>` (parking_lot)
- Crypto path: X25519 ECDH → shared secret → XChaCha20-Poly1305
- Transport priority: BLE → WiFi → mDNS → QUIC/TCP relay → Internet relay
- Storage: sled-backed, behind `Store` module boundary
