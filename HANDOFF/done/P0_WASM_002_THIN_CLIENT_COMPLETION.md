# P0_WASM_002: Thin Client Completion - Peripheral BLE & UI Lobotomy

**Priority:** P0 CRITICAL
**Platform:** WASM
**Status:** In Progress (Partial Implementation Complete)
**Source:** REMAINING_WORK_TRACKING.md - WASM thin client section
**Routing Tags:** [REQUIRES: BLE_INTEGRATION] [REQUIRES: FINALIZATION]
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-20

## Objective
Complete the WASM thin client implementation with peripheral BLE advertising and full UI lobotomy (daemon-driven operation).

## ✅ Completed Work (2026-04-20)

### 1. IronCore Mode Architecture
- **File:** `wasm/src/lib.rs`
- **Status:** Implemented
- Added `IronCoreMode` enum with `Full` and `Daemon` variants
- Implemented `set_iron_core_mode()` and `get_iron_core_mode()` methods
- Added `daemon_socket_url` storage for JSON-RPC WebSocket connections

### 2. Daemon Gating Implementation
- **File:** `wasm/src/lib.rs`
- **Status:** Implemented
- `initialize_identity()` now rejects local initialization in Daemon mode
- `initialize_identity_from_daemon()` validates daemon configuration
- `get_identity_from_daemon()` provides placeholder for daemon-managed identity

### 3. Compile Fix
- Fixed Rust borrow checker errors:
  - Moved `MutexGuard` dereference before cloning URL
  - Used `*self.daemon_socket_url.lock().clone()` pattern

### 4. BLE Central Ingress
- **File:** `cli/src/ble_mesh.rs`
- **Status:** Working
- Central scan + notify subscription working
- Drift framing + JSON-RPC forwarding to UI

## ⏸️ Remaining Work

### 1. BLE Peripheral Advertising
- **File:** `cli/src/ble_mesh.rs`
- **Status:** Stub Implemented
- `run_ble_peripheral_advertising()` currently just logs and loops
- Requires full platform advertising support (btleplug limitation on some platforms)

### 2. Daemon Bridge Integration
- **File:** `wasm/src/daemon_bridge.rs`
- **Status:** Wire Helpers Complete
- JSON-RPC request/response formatting implemented
- Missing: WebSocket client, reconnection logic, message routing

### 3. Transport Layer Enhancement
- **File:** `wasm/src/transport.rs`
- **Status:** WebSocket infrastructure complete
- Need: IronCore mode detection for routing decisions
- Need: Fallback to local mode when daemon unavailable

### 4. Verification Tests
- **File:** tests/daemon_integration_test.rs
- **Status:** Not Started
- Need: Headless browser test harness
- Need: Daemon-driven UI state testing

## Success Criteria

### Completed
- ✅ WASM client compiles without errors
- ✅ IronCore mode switching implemented
- ✅ Daemon socket URL configuration working
- ✅ Identity initialization gating in place

### Required for Completion
- ⏸️ BLE peripheral advertising (btleplug platform support)
- ⏸️ Full daemon bridge with WebSocket client
- ⏸️ Headless browser test verification
- ⏸️ End-to-end daemon-driven messaging flow

## Priority: CRITICAL
Required for complete WASM transport parity and production readiness.

## Notes
- The core architecture is now in place and compiles.
- The main remaining gap is the actual WebSocket communication with the daemon.
- BLE peripheral advertising is blocked by btleplug's limited peripheral support on desktop platforms.
