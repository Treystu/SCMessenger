# [FOR BETA - SWEEP] Batch 2: Core Transport & Routing State Analysis

**Priority:** P1 (Next Batch Gate)
**Platform:** Core/Rust
**Status:** Open
**Batch:** B2-core-transport-routing

## Mission
Perform a full-state sweep of the B2 wiring batch (Core Transport & Routing). Identify which tasks are already wired, which are blocked, and what the highest-priority target is for Alpha to begin wiring.

## Scope
All B2 tasks from `HANDOFF/WIRING_PATCH_MANIFEST.md`:
- `core/src/transport/swarm.rs`
- `core/src/routing/multipath.rs`
- `core/src/transport/wifi_aware.rs`
- `core/src/store/relay_custody.rs`
- `core/src/transport/mesh_routing.rs`
- `core/src/routing/adaptive_ttl.rs`
- `core/src/transport/health.rs`
- `core/src/routing/optimized_engine.rs`
- `core/src/transport/observation.rs`
- `core/src/transport/internet.rs`
- `core/src/transport/relay_health.rs`
- `core/src/transport/circuit_breaker.rs`
- `core/src/transport/nat.rs`
- `core/src/transport/bootstrap.rs`
- `core/src/transport/behaviour.rs`
- `core/src/transport/manager.rs`
- `core/src/routing/resume_prefetch.rs`
- `core/src/routing/reputation.rs`
- `core/src/routing/timeout_budget.rs`
- `core/src/transport/ble/gatt.rs`

## Actions Required
1. Run `cargo check --workspace` and record the current error count / warning count.
2. Run `cargo test --workspace --no-run` and record compile-gate status.
3. For each B2 target file, grep for each listed `resolved_symbol` to verify if it exists and if it has production call paths (not just test stubs).
4. Check `core/tests/` for existing integration tests that exercise transport/routing/custody paths. Note gaps.
5. Review `HANDOFF/WIRING_PATCH_MANIFEST.md` line numbers against current file state. Flag any stale anchors.
6. Look for any `TODO`, `FIXME`, or `unimplemented!()` blocks inside the B2 file set.
7. Output findings to `HANDOFF/ACTIVE_LEDGER.md` with the following sections:
   - `## Current Compile Gate Status`
   - `## B2 Task Triage (Wired / Stub-Only / Broken Anchor / Missing)`
   - `## Priority Target Recommendation` (single task or small cluster, with rationale)
   - `## Blockers & Risks`

## Output Artifact
`HANDOFF/ACTIVE_LEDGER.md` — this is the canonical input for the Orchestrator's Phase 2 tasking.

## Constraints
- Do NOT modify source code. This is a read-only sweep.
- Do NOT run long-running tests; compile-gate and grep analysis only.
- Do NOT claim tasks as complete — only report observed state.
