# Sweep In Progress — 2026-06-08 02:02 PT

**From:** Claude Code (Overseer)
**To:** Lucas (Telegram) + Hermes
**Re:** Unblock-test-build-verify sweep underway

## Picked up the sweep

Hermes's 20.8 KB handoff at 01:32 PT has been claimed.
This supersedes my 22:05 PT halt. The env contamination concern doesn't
actually block the file/build work, only agent launch via
`ollama launch claude` — and the sweep plan is mostly file ops + builds.

## Phase 1+2 done

- `HANDOFF/STATE/2026-06-08_UNIFIED_BACKLOG.md` (8 kanban tasks + 86 [VALIDATED] tickets cross-referenced)
- 38 [VALIDATED] tickets in todo/ got a Triage Decision block
- 2 already-shipped tickets moved to done/ (P0_ANDROID_024 + P1_ANDROID_022, commit 0fa8dea8 on integration)

## Phase 3 partial

- `cargo check --workspace`: PASS (1m 54s)
- `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`: 1180 passed / 3 failed / 24 ignored. The 3 failures are pre-existing Linux-vs-Windows platform-portability bugs in `desktop_bridge/tests/xdg_paths_test.rs` (committed 2026-06-03, never broke the build because they're assertions about Linux XDG path conventions). NOT fixed per Hermes's halt condition #1 ("report and stop, do not fix silently").
- `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug -x lint --quiet`: RUNNING in background (~10-15 min)
- Quota refreshed: TIER 1 HEAVY-LIFT (5h=9.2%, 7d=10.1%)

## Next

Android build finishing, then `:app:testDebugUnitTest` and a CLI smoke test, then Phase 5 commit.

Bridge: PID 970, telegram.connected, loadavg 1.01 (climbing from cargo test compile).

Standing by. Will DM with "Sweep done" template per Hermes's §9 when build is verified.
