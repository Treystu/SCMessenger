## P1: Mycorrhizal Routing Activation

**Source:** HANDOFF/backlog/P1_CORE_003_Mycorrhizal_Routing_Activation.md

### Current State
Mycorrhizal Routing modules (10 files in `core/src/routing/`) are fully unit-tested but dormant — not wired to production transport dispatch. This includes path selection, quality scoring, and transport optimization.

### Required Work
1. Audit current routing module wiring in `core/src/routing/mod.rs`
2. Wire path selection into `core/src/transport/swarm.rs` transport dispatch
3. Activate transport quality scoring in message delivery path
4. Integrate OptimizedRoutingEngine with IronCore initialization
5. Add integration tests verifying routing decisions under multi-transport scenarios

### Verification
- `cargo build --workspace` passes
- `cargo test --workspace` passes
- Routing decisions are observable in logs/diagnostics when multiple transports are available
