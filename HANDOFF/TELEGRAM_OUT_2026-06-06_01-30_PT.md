# TELEGRAM — P0_025 retest PASS, full bidirectional mDNS discovery working

**Date:** 2026-06-06 01:30 PT
**Verdict:** **PASS** — all 3 pass criteria green + bonus bidirectional mDNS round-trip confirmed

## What I tested
- Fresh install of the P0_025 APK (commit `e84f4fc3`) on Pixel 6a
- Windows CLI relay started on 0.0.0.0:9101
- Logcat capture (2.5 MB, 15,583 lines)
- 5 force-stop+relaunch cycles to exercise concurrent resolves
- 58 `mDNS service found` events processed

## Pass criteria results
1. **No "listener already in use"** — 0 occurrences. The singleton is gone; per-call ResolveListener factory is the only path.
2. **No FATAL EXCEPTION** — 0 occurrences. App survived 58 concurrent resolves and 5 kill+restart cycles.
3. **App responsive through 5+ rapid peer-scan triggers** — PASS. mDNS service restarted cleanly (PID 8871 -> 9242), app alive throughout.

## Bonus: full bidirectional mDNS discovery
- **Android discovered the Windows CLI's mDNS broadcast** at 192.168.0.138:9001 (peer-id `12D3KooWPD7Mkc9k5Xjyk6BJW2zUKCQpAXEFxv6PvyWCjwiB9z98`) and fed it to SwarmBridge.
- **Windows CLI discovered the Android phone's mDNS broadcast** (same peer-id) via `libp2p_mdns::behaviour`, registered it with `capabilities: [Internet, Local], reachable=true`, and shared its 245-entry ledger with it.
- The complete Android<->Windows LAN discovery round-trip is now working end-to-end.
