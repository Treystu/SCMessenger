## What was done this session

### Priority 0: CI red on main -- FIXED (commit bc94ffbb, not yet pushed)

All three independent CI failures resolved:

**1. Lint (cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -D warnings)**

Eleven core errors and four CLI errors, each individually fixed:

- `core/src/store/outbox.rs` -- removed unused `now` variable (line 303); removed
  redundant `as u32` cast (line 708)
- `core/src/crypto/ratchet.rs` -- `#[allow(dead_code)]` on `handle_dh_ratchet` (a PQC
  placeholder function -- not dead in intent, just not called yet; E1 will wire it)
- `core/src/crypto/encrypt.rs` -- `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` on
  `encrypt_with_ratchet_fallback` (9 args by design -- security-sensitive signature,
  no refactor without adversarial review); `map_or(false, |m| ...)` -> `is_some_and(...)`
- `core/src/crypto/session_manager.rs` -- `#[allow(too_many_arguments)]` on
  `create_receiver_session_hybrid` (8 args, same rationale as above)
- `core/src/lib.rs` -- redundant `as u32` cast removed
- `core/src/identity/keys.rs` -- `is_some()` + `expect()` pattern replaced with
  `if let Some(mldsa_kp) = self.mldsa_keypair.as_ref()`
- `core/src/drift/store.rs` -- `contains_key` + `insert` pattern replaced with
  `entry()` API
- `core/src/mobile_bridge.rs` -- two nested `if` blocks collapsed to single `&&`
  condition; `cargo fmt` applied to bring line-breaks in line
- `cli/src/api.rs` -- `RunStatus` made `pub` (was private type in public struct field,
  `private_interfaces` lint); `#[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods)]` on
  `handle_get_identity` and `simulate_test_harness` (serde_json::json! expands to
  internal `.unwrap()` calls which the project's `.clippy.toml` disallows)
- `cli/src/main.rs` -- `#[allow(disallowed_methods)]` on `spawn_http_health_server`
  (same serde_json reason); fixed `&&Path` double-reference in `Outbox::open_default`
  call
- `cli/src/bin/stress-test.rs` -- `% 100 == 0` replaced with `is_multiple_of(100)`

**2. FFI Surface Contract snapshot drift**

New error variants (`ConnectionLimit`, `DialSelf`, `IoException`, `MultiaddrNotSupported`,
`NoAddresses`, `OnionRoutingDisabled`) and new method `handlePeerConnectionEvent` were
added to the IronCore FFI surface (in the `#[uniffi::export]` impl block) without
updating the checked-in snapshots. Updated both:
- `scripts/ffi-snapshots/kotlin-symbols.txt`
- `scripts/ffi-snapshots/swift-symbols.txt`

These snapshots are the ground truth for `scripts/ffi_surface.sh`; they must be updated
any time the UDL or `#[uniffi::export]` methods change.

**3. integration_wifi_aware test (ubuntu-latest)**

`test_wifi_aware_peer_discovered_triggers_data_path_and_dial` was failing because commit
`84e0651d` ("fix(transport): derive real pairwise WiFi Aware PMK via X25519 ECDH")
replaced the hardcoded `[0x42u8; 32]` PMK with a real ECDH derivation via
`IronCore::derive_wifi_aware_pmk`. That function requires initialized identity keys.
The test called `service.start()` but never called `grant_consent()` +
`initialize_identity()`, so the spawned dial task exited early with `NotInitialized`
and the dial never happened.

Fix: added `core.grant_consent(); core.initialize_identity()` after `service.start()`
in the test, matching real usage. Test now passes in 0.34s locally.

## Verification state

- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings` -- exit 0 locally (Windows)
- `cargo fmt --check` -- exit 0 locally
- `integration_wifi_aware` test -- passes locally (ok. 1 passed)
- Full `cargo test --workspace --all-features` -- NOT run (too slow locally; CI will verify)
- `cargo deny check` -- NOT run locally (not installed); no dep changes so should be fine
- CI is authoritative on Linux. Commit bc94ffbb pushed to origin is the next step (Lucas's call).

## What is NOT done (priority 1+)

### PROVE_SECOND_REAL_ENDPOINT_DELIVERY
Not started this session. Recommended approach (from ticket): use a second CLI instance
pointed at the alpha relay (`/ip4/100.56.248.69/tcp/9001`) with a fresh identity as the
"Josh" substitute. This sidesteps the failed AWS Android emulator path and proves the
PROTOCOL works between two independent identities. Steps:
1. `scmessenger-cli start --relay /ip4/100.56.248.69/tcp/9001` in a second terminal
   (separate data dir)
2. Add contact (deep-link or manual public key exchange)
3. Send message both directions, confirm delivery + receipt

### V1_INSTALL_ARTIFACT_FOR_ALPHA_TESTERS
Not started. `.github/workflows/release.yml` not yet read. Open questions in the ticket
are still open (does it cover Android APK? signing approach for alpha? version tag?).

### A-04 Android receipt unification re-dispatch
`tmp/a04_dispatch.log` was 0 bytes (silent failure). Not re-dispatched this session.
Ticket is at `HANDOFF/IN_PROGRESS/A-04_ANDROID_RECEIPT_UNIFICATION.md`.

### D-05 unwrap/panic hardening
`tmp/d05_dispatch.log` was 0 bytes. Not re-dispatched. Ticket at
`HANDOFF/IN_PROGRESS/D-05_UNWRAP_PANIC_HARDENING.md`.

## Next session pick list (in order)

1. Push commit bc94ffbb to origin (`git push origin main`) -- Lucas's call per standing rule
2. Confirm CI goes green on that commit (watch all 4 jobs: Lint, Test x3, FFI Surface)
3. PROVE_SECOND_REAL_ENDPOINT_DELIVERY -- two-CLI proof, ~1-2 hours
4. V1_INSTALL_ARTIFACT -- read release.yml, answer open questions, dispatch if gap is small
5. Re-dispatch A-04 and D-05 (both zero-output; use `scripts/delegate_task.py`)

## FFI snapshot maintenance note

The FFI snapshot mechanism (`scripts/ffi_surface.sh`) requires manual update whenever:
- New error variants are added to `IronCoreError` in `api.udl`
- New methods are added to any `#[uniffi::export]` impl block
- Any callback interface changes in `api.udl`

Update procedure: on Linux (or in CI): build the cdylib, run `gen_kotlin`/`gen_swift`,
then `scripts/ffi_surface.sh --update`. On Windows you cannot run this reliably (the
generated output differs from Linux). Alternative: read the CI diff output and apply
the additions manually to the snapshot files, as was done this session.
