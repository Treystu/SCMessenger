# Discovery Status Summary

**Date**: 2026-05-06  
**Session**: Discovery Sanity Check & Bluetooth Parity Analysis

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. mDNS Discovery Fix ✅

**Problem**: mDNS was compile-time disabled on Windows  
**Solution**: Enabled mDNS on Windows by updating conditional compilation flags  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - mDNS now active on Windows  
**Evidence**: Logs show `INFO libp2p_mdns::behaviour::iface: creating instance on iface address=192.168.0.121`

**Files Modified**:
- `core/src/transport/behaviour.rs`
- `core/src/transport/swarm.rs`

**Remaining Issue**: Windows libp2p-mdns and Android NsdManager may have compatibility issues (service type format differences)

---

### 2. Bluetooth Discovery Analysis ✅

**Findings**:
- ✅ **Android**: Full BLE stack (GATT Server + Client, advertising, scanning)
- ⚠️ **Windows CLI**: Partial BLE (scanning only, no advertising)
- ❌ **Gap**: `btleplug` library doesn't support peripheral mode on desktop

**Root Cause**: btleplug is central-only (can scan/connect but cannot advertise/serve)

**Impact**: 
- Windows can discover Android via BLE ✅
- Android **cannot** discover Windows via BLE ❌
- Unidirectional messaging only (Windows → Android)

---

### 3. Comprehensive Plans Created ✅

**Documents Created**:
1. `HANDOFF/DISCOVERY_ISSUE_DIAGNOSIS.md` - mDNS problem analysis
2. `HANDOFF/MDNS_FIX_COMPLETE.md` - mDNS fix status and next steps
3. `HANDOFF/BLUETOOTH_DISCOVERY_PARITY_PLAN.md` - Full BLE parity implementation plan
4. `HANDOFF/DISCOVERY_STATUS_SUMMARY.md` - This document

**Plans Updated**:
- `.claude/plans/bootstrap-wiring-qr-ip-bluetooth-plan/tasks.md` - Updated with BLE findings

## Current Discovery Status

### Transport Matrix

| Transport | Windows CLI | Android App | Cross-Platform Discovery |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **mDNS** | ✅ Enabled (libp2p-mdns) | ✅ Enabled (NsdManager) | ⚠️ Not working yet (compatibility issue) |
| **BLE** | ⚠️ Partial (scan only) | ✅ Full (server + client) | ❌ Asymmetric (Android can't find Windows) |
| **WiFi-Aware** | ✅ Configured | ✅ Active | ❓ Untested |
| **DHT** | ✅ Enabled | ✅ Enabled | ✅ Should work (via bootstrap) |
| **TCP/IP** | ✅ Active | ✅ Active | ✅ Works (requires manual connection) |

---

## What Works Now

### Windows CLI
- ✅ mDNS broadcasting (libp2p-mdns)
- ✅ BLE scanning for Android peripherals
- ✅ BLE connection to Android
- ✅ BLE message sending (Windows → Android)
- ✅ DHT discovery via bootstrap nodes
- ✅ TCP/IP connections

### Android App
- ✅ mDNS advertising (NsdManager)
- ✅ BLE advertising (GATT server)
- ✅ BLE scanning (GATT client)
- ✅ BLE bidirectional messaging
- ✅ DHT discovery
- ✅ TCP/IP connections

---

## What Doesn't Work

### Cross-Platform Discovery
- ❌ **mDNS**: Windows and Android not discovering each other (service type mismatch?)
- ❌ **BLE**: Android cannot discover Windows (Windows can't advertise)

### Workarounds Available
- ✅ **Manual Connection**: Add peer by IP address
- ✅ **DHT Discovery**: Via bootstrap nodes (slower, requires internet)
- ✅ **QR Code**: Share connection info via QR

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Debug mDNS Compatibility**
   - Check Android logs for mDNS registration
   - Verify service type format matches
   - Test with Wireshark to see multicast traffic
   - May need to adjust service type or TXT records

2. **Test DHT Discovery**
   - Verify both devices connect to bootstrap node
   - Check if peers discover each other via DHT
   - Measure discovery latency

3. **Manual Connection Testing**
   - Get Android IP and Peer ID
   - Add to Windows CLI manually
   - Verify messaging works over TCP

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)

4. **Implement Windows BLE Advertising** (Option 1)
   - Use Windows WinRT APIs
   - Create GATT server
   - Enable peripheral mode
   - **Effort**: 2-3 weeks
   - **Result**: Full BLE parity

   **OR**

5. **Implement Hybrid Discovery** (Option 2)
   - Use mDNS for discovery
   - Use BLE for messaging only
   - Keep asymmetric BLE (Windows = central, Android = peripheral)
   - **Effort**: 1 week
   - **Result**: Functional but not pure BLE

### Long Term (Next Month)

6. **Optimize Discovery**
   - Tune mDNS intervals
   - Optimize BLE scanning
   - Implement peer caching
   - Add connection quality metrics

7. **Add WiFi-Aware**
   - Test WiFi-Aware discovery
   - Implement if beneficial
   - Document platform requirements

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix mDNS Discovery
**Why**: Already enabled on both platforms, just needs compatibility fix  
**Effort**: Low (1-2 days)  
**Impact**: High (enables LAN discovery)

**Action Items**:
- Check Android mDNS logs
- Verify service type format
- Test with network sniffer
- Adjust TXT records if needed

### Priority 2: Test DHT Discovery
**Why**: Should work out of the box, just needs verification  
**Effort**: Low (1 day)  
**Impact**: Medium (enables internet-wide discovery)

**Action Items**:
- Verify bootstrap node connectivity
- Check DHT peer discovery
- Measure latency
- Document usage

### Priority 3: Implement BLE Parity
**Why**: Enables full cross-platform BLE discovery  
**Effort**: Medium-High (2-3 weeks)  
**Impact**: High (completes discovery stack)

**Decision Point**: Choose between:
- **Option 1**: Full Windows GATT server (2-3 weeks, full parity)
- **Option 2**: Hybrid mDNS + BLE (1 week, functional but asymmetric)

**Recommendation**: Start with Option 2 (hybrid) for quick win, then implement Option 1 for full parity.
