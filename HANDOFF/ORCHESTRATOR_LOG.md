## 2026-06-06

- `2026-06-06T01:27:00-07:00 [QUOTA_REFRESHED]` — Quota scraper run. State: `5h=25%, 7d=96.4%, reset=120min, status=ok, ts=2026-06-06T01:27:17`. Tier=HEAVY-LIFT (5h≤25% gates Tier 1). 7d window in TIER 4 territory (96.4% < 99.5% HARDLOCK threshold) — no auto-shutoff. Effective slots: 1 (per `.claude/agent_pool.json` `max_concurrent: 1`). Budget: unlimited.

- `2026-06-06T01:30:00-07:00 [COLD_START_RECOVERED]` — Worker pool warmup completed by Hermes (Overseer Claude not running at session start). Created `HANDOFF/IN_PROGRESS/`, `.claude/agents/`, `HANDOFF/ORCHESTRATOR_LOG.md`. Pool manager reports `Slots: 0/3, OS Processes: 0/3, No agents active.` Overseer OODA path: `ollama launch claude --model <model>` available in WSL via Ollama 0.24.0. **Framework state: Overseer=DOWN, Hermes=UP, Pool=READY, Quota=TIER-1-HEAVY-LIFT.**

- `2026-06-06T01:30:00-07:00 [OVERNIGHT_DIRECTIVE]` — Lucas directive: "iterate on all unfinished work product, wake Claude, ensure Claude keeps working all night." Overseer (Claude) needs to be launched in background. Worker pool needs to be filled with a single worker (max_concurrent=1) processing the priority queue. Plan: (1) launch Overseer fresh, (2) have Overseer pick up the P0_025 retest first, (3) then dispatch workers through the [VALIDATED] P0/P1/P2 backlog, (4) Hermes babysits via Telegram notifications.
