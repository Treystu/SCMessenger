# Resume State — 2026-07-04 (native Cowork session)

Read this first if you're picking this up next. It tells you exactly what's real,
what's draft, what's blocked, and the precise next commands to run.

## The one hard blocker that shaped this whole session

**This sandbox has no working Rust toolchain (no cargo, no rustc) and no package-install
rights (no root/sudo), and cannot delete `.git/index.lock` even though nothing in the
sandbox holds it.** Confirmed repeatedly, across at least 6 separate subagent sessions
today, all independently hitting the identical wall. This is an environment limitation,
not a flaky one-off — don't waste time re-attempting `rustup`/`apt install` from this
sandbox again. `git status`/`git diff`/reads all work fine; only writes (`git add`,
`git commit`) are blocked.

**Practical implication:** everything below marked "implemented" was verified by careful
source-reading (grep + Read), not by an actual `cargo build`/`cargo test` run, unless
explicitly marked VERIFIED WITH REAL OUTPUT. Anyone with a working toolchain (you, agy/
Antigravity on the Windows machine, or a future session with proper tool access) should
run the verify commands below before trusting any of this as done.

## What's genuinely new/changed on disk right now (uncommitted)

Nothing has been committed this session — the index lock blocked every attempt. Real,
reviewed changes sitting in the working tree:

- `desktop_bridge/Cargo.toml`, `desktop_bridge/src/{ble,desktop_bridge,lib,notification,power,socket_activation,tray,xdg_paths}.rs` (modified), `desktop_bridge/src/types.rs` (new) — the crate is now believed to actually compile (`cargo check -p scmessenger-desktop-bridge` passed in one subagent's environment) but `cargo build --workspace`/`cargo test` were never confirmed due to timeouts, not failures.
- `cli/src/server.rs` — one-line fix in `AcceptMessageRequest` (T2's key-lookup bug).
- `wasm/src/notification_manager.rs` — one dead_code annotation removed (`save_notification_settings` — prior triage was wrong, it does have a real caller).
- 92 files now in `HANDOFF/todo/` (see below), plus doc moves/archives (see Phase 0).
- `docs/historical/REMAINING_WORK_TRACKING_ARCHIVE_2026.md` (new) — pre-2026-07-02 history moved out of the live tracking file.
- `HANDOFF/done/P1_ANDROID_CRASH_TRIAGE.md`, `HANDOFF/done/P1_ANDROID_LAN_DISCOVERY_REPAIR.md` — moved from todo/, verified already-fixed by commit `87d1ef61`. **Note:** one subagent reported it couldn't actually `git mv` (no shell access in its session) and left stub pointer files in `todo/` instead — check both directories to see which state actually landed.
- CLAUDE.md's version line fixed (0.2.1 -> 0.3.4), already applied by me directly.

**~250+ other modified files are pre-existing CRLF/line-ending noise and unrelated
in-flight work from other sessions (agy/Antigravity) — do NOT commit these blindly.**
Every subagent was explicitly told to scope its commits to only its own files; none
could actually commit due to the lock, so this is untested but the intent is documented
per-subagent in the reports below.

## Immediate next steps (in order) for whoever has a real toolchain + unlocked git

1. Clear `.git/index.lock` (should be safe — confirmed stale/no live process via `ps aux`
   in every sandbox session, likely a leftover from an earlier crashed process on the
   Windows host; a plain `git status` in PowerShell often clears a stale lock on its own,
   or delete it manually since it's your own file).
2. `cd desktop_bridge && export CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 && cargo build --workspace && cargo test -p scmessenger-desktop-bridge && cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings -A clippy::empty_line_after_doc_comments` — this is the single highest-value verification run outstanding. If it passes, commit desktop_bridge/ changes alone.
3. Run the T1-T7/S4/S5 verify commands in `HANDOFF/RELEASE_READINESS_FIXES_DRAFT.md`'s "Remaining gaps" section. If they pass, commit those specific files alone (see that doc for the exact file list).
4. T3 and T7 (session_manager.rs, backup.rs) — even after tests pass, these are **blocked on the mandatory `crypto-security-auditor` adversarial review** per `.claude/rules/security.md` before being called done. Don't skip this step just because tests are green.
5. Regenerate `HANDOFF/WIRING_TASK_INDEX.md`/`WIRING_PATCH_MANIFEST.{json,md}` via `python scripts/generate_wiring_patch_manifest.py` — never actually run this session (no Python confirmed available either in most sandbox instances). `HANDOFF/WIRING_MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` has a note flagging these as stale in the meantime.
6. Work through the new `HANDOFF/todo/` items (see inventory below) roughly in this order: ready-to-implement, non-crypto items first (cheap wins); then NEEDS PLANNING items (need your/human input, not more agent guessing); PQC waves 2+ continue on agy's track separately.

## Full inventory of docs written this session (all in `HANDOFF/` unless noted)

- `V1_0_0_UNIFICATION_PLAN.md` — the overall synthesis: what's actually open vs. already
  done across PQC, the (already-complete) 350-task wiring backlog, release-readiness,
  dead-code, and KMP desktop scope. Read this for the big picture.
- `DESKTOP_BRIDGE_WIRING_SPEC.md` — original research spec (now largely implemented, see
  above); still useful for the precise UDL-derived type definitions if anything needs
  re-deriving.
- `DEAD_CODE_TRIAGE_RESULTS.md` — all 39 originally-audited items classified
  wired/stub/dead, plus one correction logged today (WASM notification_manager.rs).
- `RELEASE_READINESS_FIXES_DRAFT.md` — T1-T7/S4/S5 status; almost everything already
  implemented in source, pending real compile/test verification and the T3/T7 security
  review.
- `SMALL_FIXES_STATUS.md` — S2/S3/S6/S7; all confirmed already-correct in source, S7
  (CRLF normalization) was actually executed this session (28 files, verified
  zero-content-diff via `--ignore-space-at-eol`).
- `docs/historical/REMAINING_WORK_TRACKING_ARCHIVE_2026.md` — archived pre-2026-07-02
  history from `REMAINING_WORK_TRACKING.md`.

## New HANDOFF/todo/ items from today's comprehensive sweep (ready to hand to any agent/session)

**Ready-to-implement (ordered roughly by simplicity/risk):**
- `ANDROID_SWEEP_01_hardcoded_strings_contacts_settings.md` — ~28 hardcoded UI strings + ~16 hardcoded contentDescriptions across 8 files, need extraction to strings.xml. Mechanical, low-risk.
- `P2_IOS_ContactManagerFix_TryBang_FFI_Crash_Risk.md` — `try!` on 2 UniFFI calls, inconsistent with rest of file's error handling.
- `P2_IOS_Silent_TryQuestion_Swallows_Contact_And_Topic_Actions.md` — same bug class as already-fixed T15, missed in 2 more files.
- `P3_IOS_SimulateBackgroundProcessing_Missing_Maintenance_Steps.md` — residual gap in T17's fix (missing 2 of 3 maintenance steps in the simulated background handler).
- `CORE_SWEEP_01_history_enforce_retention_panic.md` — `.expect()` panic risk on corrupt sled record during retention pruning.
- `CORE_SWEEP_02_iron_core_bridge_manager_double_fallback_panic.md` — panic if both primary and fallback contact/history manager construction fail. Has a documented design fork (may need a UniFFI signature change) — read carefully before implementing.
- `P2_CLI_Identity_Info_Expect_Panics_On_Startup_And_Diagnostics.md` — CLI startup/diagnostics panic risk.
- `P2_WASM_Notification_Permission_JS_Interop_Unwrap_Panic.md` — `Reflect::apply().unwrap()` panic risk in browser notification permission flow.

**[NEEDS PLANNING] — do not implement without a design decision first:**
- `ANDROID_SWEEP_02_NEEDS_PLANNING_smart_transport_router_unused_params.md` — unclear whether unused params in `SmartTransportRouter.attemptDelivery()` are dead plumbing, incomplete instrumentation, or reserved API. Needs a human call.
- `[NEEDS PLANNING] CORE_SWEEP_03_ble_gatt_traits_never_implemented.md` — `GattServer`/`GattClient` traits in `core/src/transport/ble/gatt.rs` have zero implementations anywhere; is BLE GATT actually functional or is this dead architecture? This also touches `transport/`, so it's mandatory-review-gated regardless of what's decided.
- `[NEEDS PLANNING]_P2_CLI_Orphaned_History_And_Contacts_Modules.md` — `cli/src/history.rs`/`contacts.rs` may be a fully orphaned duplicate of core's `HistoryManager`/`ContactManager`; needs a decision on whether to delete, merge, or document as intentional duplication.
- `CORE_SWEEP_04_systemic_unix_epoch_expect_pattern.md` — informational note on a 67-occurrence pattern across 20 files; explicitly recommends against a mass mechanical edit, flagging it for awareness rather than action.

**Also still in `HANDOFF/todo/` from before today, unrelated to this session's sweep:**
`TASK_KMP_*` (4 files — Linux desktop client, confirmed in-scope for v1.0.0 by the user;
see `V1_0_0_UNIFICATION_PLAN.md` Phase 4 and `DESKTOP_BRIDGE_WIRING_SPEC.md` for the
Rust-side state), `PQC_02` through `PQC_14` (agy's active track, PQC-01 done), plus ~55
`[VALIDATED]_*` files that are substantively complete historical records, not open work.

## Things I could not do and why (be honest with the next session about these)

- Could not compile-verify ANYTHING in this sandbox (no toolchain, no install rights).
- Could not commit ANYTHING (`.git/index.lock` blocked every write operation, all session).
- Could not run the mandatory `crypto-security-auditor` review on T3/T7 or the BLE GATT
  question — I don't have a way to invoke that specific subagent type distinctly from a
  general-purpose one in a way that would satisfy the adversarial-review intent; this
  needs either a real Claude Code session with that subagent configured, or a human
  security pass.
- 3 of my first-round gap-sweep subagents hit an Anthropic session/quota limit mid-run
  with zero output (not a task failure — just ran out of budget); they were successfully
  re-run once quota reset and did produce real output the second time.
- Did not touch the Linux desktop KMP `shared/` Kotlin layer beyond documenting its state
  (still a bare 2-file skeleton, no real UI, not wired to Android's `settings.gradle`) —
  that's genuine multi-week greenfield work, not a quick spec.

## What "done" actually means right now, plainly

Nothing shipped today is proven by a real build. What shipped is: one real, scoped code
fix (S7's CRLF normalization, self-verifying via diff comparison, no compiler needed);
several confirmations that earlier work (by other sessions, possibly agy) was already
correct; a large, precise, well-researched backlog of new findings ready for
implementation or explicit human decision; and full documentation of exactly what's
blocked and why. That is real progress for a session with no build tools and no commit
access — but it is not the same as "verified and merged," and I don't want to overstate
it.
