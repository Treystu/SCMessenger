You are a senior technical writer and Rust systems engineer. Your task is to implement P1-13 documentation updates (Hardcode Sweep).

The system now uses adaptive port selection (a port ladder: negotiated, last-known-good, 443, 80, 8080) instead of hardcoded 9001 and 9002 ports.
Please provide the FULL, completely updated contents of the following documentation file using standard Markdown code blocks. Replace references to fixed "port 9001" and "port 9002" with explanations of adaptive port selection and the fallback ladder. 

1. `docs/RELAY_OPERATOR_GUIDE.md`:
   - Keep 9001 as the documented preferred-first default for relay operators (so they still open 9001 in firewalls), but explain that clients now use an adaptive port ladder (443, 80, 8080, etc.) if 9001 fails, and relay operators should consider allowing 443.

Provide only the file contents in code blocks. Do not omit any existing text.
