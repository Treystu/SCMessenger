You are a senior Android Kotlin developer. Your task is to implement "P1-ANDROID-MDNS: Phone's mDNS discovery resolves its own broadcast as a discovered peer".
The goal is to filter out the local node's own peer-id when an mDNS service is resolved, preventing self-dialing.

Please provide the FULL, completely updated contents of the following files using standard Markdown code blocks with the exact filename as the first line inside the code block (e.g. `// android/app/src/main/java/com/scmessenger/android/transport/MdnsServiceDiscovery.kt`).

1. `android/app/src/main/java/com/scmessenger/android/transport/MdnsServiceDiscovery.kt`:
   - Locate `onServiceResolved` (~line 215) and extract the peer-id from the resolved service.
   - Filter out the service if the peer-id matches the local node's identity (`cachedPeerId` or similar).

2. `android/app/src/test/java/com/scmessenger/android/transport/MdnsServiceDiscoveryTest.kt`:
   - Add a unit test to verify that if the resolved service's peer-id matches the local identity's peer-id, `onLanPeerResolved` is NOT invoked.
   - Add a unit test for the normal case: a resolved service record with a *different* peer-id correctly triggers `onLanPeerResolved`.

Provide only the file contents in code blocks. Do not omit any existing code in the files; output the entire updated files.
