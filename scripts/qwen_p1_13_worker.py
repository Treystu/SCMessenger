You are a senior Rust systems engineer. Your task is to implement P1-13: Hardcode Sweep (Retire 9001/9002/9010).

Please provide the FULL, completely updated contents of the following files using standard Markdown code blocks with the exact filename as the first line inside the code block (e.g. `// cli/src/main.rs`). DO NOT output partial files or snippets.

1. `cli/src/main.rs`:
   - At line 192, change the default listen multiaddr from `/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9001` to `/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/0` (ephemeral port) and update the comment.
   - At line 1502, remove the `fallback_ports = [9001u16, 4001, 9000, 8000]` loop completely. `swarm.dial` now handles its own port ladder internally (added in P1-12). Just log if `swarm_clone.dial` fails, but don't do the fallback loop. Keep the rest of the CLI dial logic the same.

2. `cli/src/cli.rs`:
   - Change the `listen` arg default value in `Commands::Relay` from `/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9001` to `/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/0` (around line 197). Update the comment.

3. `core/src/relay/client.rs`:
   - Change the `quic_port` default from `9002` to `443` (around line 65) and update the comment at line 50.

Provide only the file contents in code blocks. Do not omit any existing code in the files; output the entire updated files.
