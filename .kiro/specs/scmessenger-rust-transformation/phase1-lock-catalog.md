## Summary

### WASM Crate (HIGH PRIORITY - MUST CHANGE)
- **Total locks**: 7 files with parking_lot::Mutex/RwLock
- **Action**: Replace ALL with Rc<RefCell<T>>
- **Reason**: WASM is single-threaded, Arc/Mutex/RwLock are unnecessary overhead
- **Files to modify**:
  1. wasm/src/lib.rs
  2. wasm/src/daemon_bridge.rs
  3. wasm/src/worker.rs
  4. wasm/src/transport.rs
  5. wasm/src/storage.rs
  6. wasm/src/mesh.rs
  7. wasm/src/connection_state.rs

### CLI Crate (ALREADY CORRECT)
- **Total locks**: tokio::sync::Mutex in async contexts
- **Action**: KEEP - already using correct async-aware locks
- **Files**: cli/src/main.rs

### Core Crate (ALREADY CORRECT)
- **Total locks**: parking_lot::Mutex/RwLock in sync contexts
- **Action**: KEEP - parking_lot is correct for synchronous code
- **Reason**: Core crate is used by mobile (native threads), not WASM
- **Files**: 20+ files using parking_lot correctly

## Lock Replacement Strategy

### Phase 1.2: WASM Lock Replacement

**Pattern to Replace:**
```rust
use parking_lot::{Mutex, RwLock};
use std::sync::Arc;

pub struct WasmMeshNode {
    state: Arc<RwLock<MeshNodeState>>,
    peers: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, PeerInfo>>>,
}
```

**Target Pattern:**
```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::Rc;

pub struct WasmMeshNode {
    state: Rc<RefCell<MeshNodeState>>,
    peers: Rc<RefCell<HashMap<String, PeerInfo>>>,
}

impl WasmMeshNode {
    pub fn with_state<F, R>(&self, f: F) -> R 
    where F: FnOnce(&MeshNodeState) -> R 
    {
        f(&*self.state.borrow())
    }
    
    pub fn with_state_mut<F, R>(&self, f: F) -> R 
    where F: FnOnce(&mut MeshNodeState) -> R 
    {
        f(&mut *self.state.borrow_mut())
    }
}
```

### Critical Considerations

1. **RefCell Panic Risk**: RefCell::borrow_mut() will panic if already borrowed
   - Must verify no overlapping borrows
   - Must verify no borrows held across await points
   - Add helper methods to encapsulate borrow patterns

2. **Clone Semantics**: Rc::clone() is cheap (reference count increment)
   - Replace Arc::clone() with Rc::clone()
   - Verify all clone sites

3. **Send/Sync Removal**: Rc<RefCell<T>> is NOT Send or Sync
   - This is CORRECT for WASM (single-threaded)
   - Will cause compile errors if accidentally used in multi-threaded code
   - This is a FEATURE, not a bug

4. **Performance**: Rc<RefCell<T>> is faster than Arc<Mutex<T>>
   - No atomic operations
   - No lock contention
   - Zero overhead for single-threaded code

## Verification Checklist

After WASM lock replacement:
- [ ] wasm-pack build succeeds
- [ ] parking_lot removed from wasm/Cargo.toml
- [ ] No Arc<Mutex<T>> or Arc<RwLock<T>> in wasm/src/
- [ ] All Rc<RefCell<T>> usage verified safe (no overlapping borrows)
- [ ] No runtime panics in browser tests
- [ ] WASM bundle size measured (should be smaller)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Task 1.1: Catalog complete
2. ⏳ Task 1.2: Replace WASM locks with RefCell
3. ⏳ Task 1.3: Standardize CLI async locks (already correct, verify only)
4. ⏳ Task 1.4: Migrate Hyper 0.14 to Axum 0.7
5. ⏳ Task 1.5: Verify Hyper 0.14 removal
6. ⏳ Task 1.6: Phase 1 verification gate

**Phase 1.1 Status: ✅ COMPLETE**
