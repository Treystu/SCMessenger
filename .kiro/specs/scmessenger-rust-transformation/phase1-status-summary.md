# Phase 1 Status Summary
## SCMessenger Rust Transformation - Async Hygiene

**Date:** 2026-05-06  
**Current Task:** 1.2 - Replace WASM Locks with RefCell  
**Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE

---

## Completed Work

### Task 1.1: Catalog All Lock Usage ✅ COMPLETE
- Created comprehensive lock catalog at `.kiro/specs/scmessenger-rust-transformation/phase1-lock-catalog.md`
- Identified 7 WASM files requiring lock replacement
- Identified CLI crate already using correct tokio::sync locks
- Identified core crate correctly using parking_lot for sync contexts

### Task 1.2: Replace WASM Locks with RefCell ⏳ IN PROGRESS

**Files Completed:**
1. ✅ wasm/src/lib.rs - Main IronCore struct updated
2. ✅ wasm/src/daemon_bridge.rs - Already updated
3. ✅ wasm/src/connection_state.rs - Fully updated

**Files Remaining:**
4. ⏳ wasm/src/transport.rs - Imports updated, struct fields need updating (27+ errors)
5. ⏳ wasm/src/worker.rs - Not started
6. ⏳ wasm/src/storage.rs - Not started
7. ⏳ wasm/src/mesh.rs - Not started

---

## Current Compilation Status

**Command:** `cargo check -p scmessenger-wasm`  
**Status:** FAILING  
**Errors:** 27+ errors in transport.rs

**Error Pattern:**
- `cannot find type Arc in this scope` - Need to replace with `Rc`
- `cannot find type RwLock in this scope` - Need to replace with `RefCell`

**Affected Lines in transport.rs:**
- Line 96, 98, 106, 112 - WebSocketRelay struct
- Line 420 - WebRtcTransport struct  
- Line 1069, 1070, 1076, 1080 - WebRtcPeer struct
- Line 1142, 1143, 1144, 1152, 1153, 1154 - WasmTransport struct

---

## Remaining Work for Task 1.2

### wasm/src/transport.rs
**Estimated changes:** 50+ replacements
- Replace all `Arc<RwLock<T>>` with `Rc<RefCell<T>>`
- Replace all `.write()` with `.borrow_mut()`
- Replace all `.read()` with `.borrow()`
- Replace all `Arc::new()` with `Rc::new()`
- Replace all `Arc::clone()` with `Rc::clone()`

### wasm/src/worker.rs
**Estimated changes:** 10+ replacements
- Similar pattern to transport.rs

### wasm/src/storage.rs
**Estimated changes:** 10+ replacements
- Similar pattern to transport.rs

### wasm/src/mesh.rs
**Estimated changes:** 15+ replacements
- Similar pattern to transport.rs

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Manual Replacement (Recommended)
1. Complete transport.rs (largest file)
2. Complete worker.rs
3. Complete storage.rs
4. Complete mesh.rs
5. Run `cargo check -p scmessenger-wasm` to verify
6. Mark Task 1.2 as complete
7. Proceed to Task 1.3 (CLI async locks - already correct, just verify)
8. Proceed to Task 1.4 (Hyper → Axum migration)

### Option 2: Use Find/Replace Script
Create a PowerShell script to automate the replacements:
- `Arc<RwLock<` → `Rc<RefCell<`
- `.write()` → `.borrow_mut()`
- `.read()` → `.borrow()`
- `Arc::new(RwLock::new(` → `Rc::new(RefCell::new(`
- `Arc::clone(` → `Rc::clone(` (only in WASM files)

---

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**Risks:**
1. RefCell will panic on overlapping borrows
2. Large number of changes increases chance of errors
3. WASM-specific code is harder to test without browser

**Mitigations:**
1. Code already follows pattern of cloning before await
2. WASM is single-threaded, so no concurrent access
3. Compilation will catch most errors
4. Can verify with `cargo check` before full build

---

## Time Estimate

**Remaining work:** 2-3 hours
- transport.rs: 1 hour
- worker.rs: 30 minutes
- storage.rs: 30 minutes
- mesh.rs: 30 minutes
- Testing/verification: 30 minutes

---

## Recommendation

Continue with manual replacement, starting with transport.rs. This is the safest approach and allows for careful review of each change. The pattern is consistent, so once transport.rs is complete, the other files will be straightforward.

After completing Task 1.2, Tasks 1.3-1.6 should be relatively quick:
- Task 1.3: CLI locks already correct (just verify)
- Task 1.4: Hyper → Axum migration (well-documented)
- Task 1.5: Verify Hyper removal (simple check)
- Task 1.6: Verification gate (run tests)

**Phase 1 Completion Estimate:** 4-5 hours total from current state
