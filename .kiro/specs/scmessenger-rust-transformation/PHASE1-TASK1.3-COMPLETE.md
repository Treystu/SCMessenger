# Phase 1 Task 1.3 Complete: CLI Async Lock Verification

**Date:** 2026-05-06  
**Task:** Verify CLI async locks are correct  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Verification Performed

Ran clippy with `await_holding_lock` lint:
```bash
cargo clippy -p scmessenger-cli -- -W clippy::await_holding_lock
```

## Result

**No warnings about `await_holding_lock`** were found in the CLI crate.

The CLI crate already uses `tokio::sync::Mutex` correctly in async contexts:
- `cli/src/main.rs` uses `tokio::sync::Mutex` for shared state
- No blocking locks (`std::sync::Mutex` or `parking_lot::Mutex`) are held across await points

## Conclusion

Task 1.3 is verified complete. The CLI crate already follows best practices for async lock usage.

**Next Task:** 1.4 - Migrate Hyper 0.14 → Axum 0.7
