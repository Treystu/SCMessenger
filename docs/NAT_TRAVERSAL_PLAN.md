# NAT Traversal & Internet Roaming — Implementation Plan

## [Current] Overview

SCMessenger enables **cross-network messaging** via a multi-layered traversal strategy:

1. **Bootstrap Nodes** — Well-known relay nodes that help peers discover each other.
2. **NAT Detection** — Determines NAT type via `autonat` and `address_reflection`.
3. **UPnP Port Mapping** — Automatic port mapping on compatible home routers.
4. **Hole Punching** — DCUtR establishes direct connections through compatible NATs.
5. **Consensus Address Advertisement** — Peers use observed external addresses for direct P2P.
6. **Relay Circuits** — Fallback relayed connections when direct paths are unavailable.
7. **Internet Roaming** — Seamless connectivity preservation during network transitions.

## [Current] Phase 1: Bootstrap Node Configuration (Rust Core)

### What

Added configurable bootstrap node addresses that the swarm auto-dials on startup.

### Changes

1. `SwarmCommand` accepts bootstrap addresses.
2. Mobile apps configure bootstrap nodes from settings.
3. Auto-dial triggers on startup and network change.

---

## [Current] Phase 2: NAT Detection & UPnP Integration

### What

Integration of `autonat`, `address_reflection`, and `UPnP`.

### Changes

1. Added `libp2p::upnp` to `IronCoreBehaviour`.
2. Swarm handles UPnP events (`NewExternalAddr`, `PortMapping`).
3. External addresses discovered via UPnP are automatically added to the swarm for advertisement.
4. NAT status is exposed to the platform layer via `MeshService.get_nat_status()`.

---

## [Current] Phase 3: Hole Punching (DCUtR Integration)

### What

Support for libp2p's DCUtR (Direct Connection Upgrade through Relay).

### Changes

1. Added `libp2p::dcutr` to behaviour.
2. DCUtR automatically attempts to upgrade relay connections to direct paths.
3. Successful hole-punches are logged and result in direct peer connectivity.

---

## [Current] Phase 4: Consensus Address Advertisement

### What

Nodes now build consensus on their external address and proactively advertise it.

### Changes

1. `AddressObserver` aggregates observations from multiple peers.
2. When consensus is reached (multiple peers see the same IP:Port), the address is added to the swarm.
3. Addresses observed via the `Identify` protocol are similarly validated and advertised.
4. This ensures that even if UPnP is unavailable, peers can attempt direct P2P to verified external endpoints.

---

## [Current] Phase 5: Relay Circuit Fallback

### What

Relay-based communication for peers behind symmetric or restrictive NATs.

### Changes

1. Automatic fallback to `/p2p-circuit/` when direct dials fail.
2. `MultiPathDelivery` (Phase 6) manages retries across direct and relayed paths.
3. Store-and-forward support in the relay node ensures message delivery for offline recipients.

---

## [Current] Phase 6: Internet Roaming

### What

Connectivity preservation during WiFi/Cellular transitions.

### Changes

1. Network change events trigger bootstrap re-dials.
2. NAT re-probing ensures updated external address advertisement.
3. Keep-alive pings maintain active relay circuit reservations.

---

## [Current] Verification Status

- **Unit Tests**: NAT detection and `AddressObserver` consensus logic verified.
- **Manual Verification**: Successfully tested message delivery across cellular networks with relay fallback and direct P2P transition.
- **UPnP**: Verified on compatible gateways with port mapping status reporting.
